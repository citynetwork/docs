# When invoked as just "gitlint" without any other arguments, Gitlint
# processes the most recent commit message *unless* it's being fed
# data on stdin, in which case it assumes that what comes in is a
# commit message. That means it breaks on the pre-push hook, which
# puts the list of to-be-pushed revisions on stdin. We can work around
# that by telling Gitlint to always ignore stdin.
