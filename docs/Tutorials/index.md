# About our tutorials

Our tutorials are gentle introductions to {{config.extra.brand}}. They
generally require very little prior knowledge and assume only that you
have access to a browser, or to a terminal.

We group these into two major categories:

* **Browser-based tutorials** get you started on
  {{config.extra.brand}} using the
  [{{config.extra.brand}} Admin Panel](https://admin.{{config.extra.brand_domain}}/).

* **Terminal-based tutorials** introduce you to command-line
  interfaces (CLIs) and their interaction with
  {{config.extra.brand}}â€™s web-based Application Programming
  Interfaces (APIs).

This section does *not* include detailed walkthroughs of specific
technical tasks. For those, please see our [How-To
Guides](../How-To_Guides/index.md) section.

!!! note

    If you find our tutorials helpful, you might also be interested in our
	self-paced online training courses, available from
	[our course booking site](https://shop.{{config.extra.company_domain}}).
