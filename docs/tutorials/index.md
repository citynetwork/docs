# About our tutorials

Our tutorials are gentle introductions to {{brand}}. They
generally require very little prior knowledge and assume only that you
have access to a browser, or to a terminal.

We group these into two major categories:

* **Browser-based tutorials** get you started on
  {{brand}} using the
  [{{gui}}](https://{{gui_domain}}/).

* **Terminal-based tutorials** introduce you to command-line
  interfaces (CLIs) and their interaction with
  {{brand}}’s web-based Application Programming
  Interfaces (APIs).

This section does *not* include detailed walkthroughs of specific
technical tasks. For those, please see our [How-To
Guides](../howto/) section.

> If you find our tutorials helpful, you might also be interested in
> our self-paced online training courses, available from [our course
> booking site](https://shop.{{company_domain}}).
