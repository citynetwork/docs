# About our tutorials

Our tutorials cover specific use cases in {{brand}}.
We host them on our learning platform, [{{academy}}](https://{{academy_domain}}/).

Our tutorials generally require that you [have a {{brand}} account](../howto/getting-started/create-account.md), and that you are registered on [shop.cleura.com](https://shop.{{company_domain}}).
Once you are registered, you may go to our [Cloud Course Catalog](https://shop.{{company_domain}}/course-category/tutorials/), pick any of the tutorials, and put them in your cart for free.

Although access to our tutorials is free of charge, please keep in mind that any resources you create in a tutorial will be charged at [our normal rates](https://{{company_domain}}/pricing/).
You may, of course, run a tutorial using your [free trial credit](https://{{company_domain}}/free-trial/).

> If you find our tutorials helpful, you might also be interested in our self-paced online training courses, available for a fee from [our course booking site](https://shop.{{company_domain}}).

Our tutorials are grouped by general topics:

* [Ansible tutorials](ansible.md)
* [Container tutorials](containers.md)
* [OpenStack Heat tutorials](heat.md)
* [OpenTofu tutorials](tf.md)
