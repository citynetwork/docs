Our tutorials generally require that you [have a {{brand}} account](../howto/getting-started/create-account.md), and that you are [registered](https://{{academy_domain}}/register) on {{academy}}.
Access to our tutorials is free of charge, however any resources you create in a tutorial will be charged at [our normal rates](https://{{company_domain}}/pricing/).
You may of course use your [free trial credit](https://{{company_domain}}/free-trial/) to run a tutorial.
