# Deleting a Open WebUI instance

This short guide covers the deletion of a self-hosted Open WebUI deployment.

In the left vertical pane of the {{gui}}, expand the *Marketplace* category and click on *Provisioned Apps*.
All your deployed applications, including the one you are about to delete, are listed in the central pane.
Notice the orange :material-dots-horizontal-circle: icon at the right of the application row.
Click on it, and from the drop-down menu that appears, select *Delete Provisioned App*.

A new window named *About to delete a Provisioned App* appears.
Make sure it refers to the Open WebUI deployment you wish to delete.
When you are ready, click on the red *Yes, Delete* button.
