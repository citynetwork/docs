# Creating a new network from the Cleura Cloud Control Panel

Before creating a server in {{extra.brand}} Cloud, you need to have a
network to make the new server a member of. You may have more than one
network per region, so let us now walk through creating a new network
using the {{extra.gui}}. Fire up your favorite web browser, navigate
to the [Cleura Cloud](https://{{extra.gui_domain}}) page, and login
into your {{extra.brand}} account.

On the top right-hand side of the {{extra.gui}}, click the _Create_
button. A new pane will slide into view from the right-hand side of
the browser window, titled _Create_.

You will notice several rounded boxes prominently displayed on that 
pane, each for defining, configuring, and instantiating a different 
{{extra.brand}} Cloud object. Go ahead and click the _Network_ box. A 
new pane titled _Create Network_ will slide over. At the top, type in a 
name and select one of the available regions for the new network.

Expand the _Advanced Options_ section below, make sure _Port 
Security_ is enabled, and leave the MTU parameter blank.

You probably want a full-featured network for your cloud servers, so
please activate the _Create a complete network containing a subnet and a router_
option. You will notice that
[a network address in CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation)
is pre-configured for your network. You also get a couple of
DNS servers, a Gateway, and a DHCP server.

Scroll down a little bit if you have to. Assuming you want your cloud 
servers to reach hosts on the Internet, for _External network_ make 
sure you select _ext-net_. Then, click the green _Create_ button to 
create the new network.

In a few seconds, the new network will be readily available. You may 
see all defined networks, in all supported regions, by selecting 
_Networking_ > _Networks_ (see the left-hand side pane on the 
{{extra.gui}}).

For more information regarding a specific network, click the 
corresponding three-dot icon (right-hand side) and select _View 
details_. Then, you can glance over all the details regarding the 
selected network's ports, subnets, and routers.
