# Deleting networks

Deleting a network in {{brand}} may sound like a pretty straightforward task --- and it is.
It's just that before deleting a network, there are some steps we almost always need to take.
In what follows we show, step by step and through specific examples, how we delete networks using either the {{gui}} or the OpenStack CLI.

## Prerequisites

Whether you choose to work from the {{gui}} or with the OpenStack CLI, you need to [have an account](../../getting-started/create-account.md) in {{brand}}.
Additionally, to use the OpenStack CLI, make sure to [enable it](../../getting-started/enable-openstack-cli.md) for the region you will be working in.

## Selecting a network

Unless you already have the ID or know the name of the network you wish to delete, you may first list all available networks.

=== "{{gui}}"
    Fire up your favorite web browser, navigate to the [{{gui}}](https://{{gui_domain}}) start page, and log into your {{brand}} account.

    In the vertical pane on the left-hand side of the dashboard, expand the _Networking_ section and click _Networks_.
    In the central pane of the page, you will see all networks in all regions you have access to.
    For the purposes of this guide, let us assume you no longer need network `carmacks`, so now you want to delete it.

    ![Listing networks](assets/del-net/shot-01.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    To list all available networks in the region you are currently in, type the following:

    ```console
    $ openstack network list --internal

    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    | ID                                   | Name         | Subnets                              |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    | 1f94d315-7ca1-4d44-acc1-09c6c650df74 | mayo         |                                      |
    | 9b127d2c-01d7-4803-994f-f88292870c1d | teslin       | bd1d0ff2-7270-4a9a-a7ad-fff47e997e7b |
    | cb0a298a-bbb6-4ad6-832a-1456dafe45db | carmacks     | 7fa9e5a2-7d5a-466e-b120-7d2bffb99ce5 |
    | e0c4ce17-2722-4777-8140-d6c87479e190 | network-{{api_region|lower}} | 421d8fd2-dd7f-4f7c-9a51-42ef4a866dd9 |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

Let us assume you wish to delete the network named `carmacks`.

## Determining component dependencies

If the network to be deleted has a subnet component --- and most likely it will have ---, you will first have to delete the subnet before deleting the network.
If, in addition, the network is behind a router (figurately speaking), then before deleting the subnet, you will have to disconnect it from the router.
Finally, you will have the option to delete the router also.
Let us see what the situation is with network `carmacks`.

=== "{{gui}}"
    For more information on `carmacks`, click the three-dot icon (right-hand side of the network row) and select _View details_.
    Four tabs immediately appear below; _Details_, _Ports_, _Subnets_, and _Routers_.
    Looking at the _Details_ tab, it is clear that network `carmacks` has a subnet and is behind a router.
    You may click on tabs _Subnets_ and _Routers_, to see more information regarding the network subnet and the router in front of the network.

    ![Network details](assets/del-net/shot-02.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    To quickly check whether network `carmacks` has a subnet or not, type:

    ```console
    $ openstack network show carmacks -c subnets

    +---------+--------------------------------------+
    | Field   | Value                                |
    +---------+--------------------------------------+
    | subnets | 7fa9e5a2-7d5a-466e-b120-7d2bffb99ce5 |
    +---------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

    If the value for the field `subnets` is non-empty, like in the example output above, that means the network has a subnet indeed, and the value is the ID of that subnet.
    At this point, it helps to assign the subnet ID to an environment variable, like so:

    ```bash
    SUBNET_ID="7fa9e5a2-7d5a-466e-b120-7d2bffb99ce5"
    ```

    What about a router in front of `carmacks`? You might try checking the output of this command:

    ```console
    $ openstack network show carmacks

    +---------------------------+--------------------------------------+
    | Field                     | Value                                |

    +---------------------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

    While it usually pays off to use `openstack` commands with the verb `show` on various objects, in this case, you don't get what you're looking for --- which is an indication of the presence or absence of a router in front of `carmacks`.
    In cases like this, try looking at things from a different vantage point.
    Try, in particular, to list all routers:

    ```console
    $ openstack router list

    +------------------------+-----------------+--------+-------+------------------------+------+
    | ID                     | Name            | Status | State | Project                | HA   |
    +------------------------+-----------------+--------+-------+------------------------+------+
    | 5ac45739-a379-4936-    | router-{{api_region|lower}}     | ACTIVE | UP    | 94109c764a754e24ac0f6b | True |
    | 8b1b-67d10e017f4d      |                 |        |       | 01aef82359             |      |
    | 79ff91ae-91b5-4991-    | carmacks-router | ACTIVE | UP    | 94109c764a754e24ac0f6b | True |
    | af61-91e923fac87b      |                 |        |       | 01aef82359             |      |
    +------------------------+-----------------+--------+-------+------------------------+------+
    ```

    The name of the second router says it all, but since it is just a name, it doesn't hurt to verify the role of this router:

    ```console
    $ openstack router show carmacks-router -c interfaces_info

    +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Field           | Value                                                                          |
    +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | interfaces_info | [{"port_id": "439bc9d5-c8a9-4de1-93b9-b01e69258a56", "ip_address": "10.1.0.1", |
    |                 | "subnet_id": "7fa9e5a2-7d5a-466e-b120-7d2bffb99ce5"}]                          |
    +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    ```

    Looking at the value of `interfaces_info`, it is easy to see that `subnet_id` has the value of the variable `SUBNET_ID` you just instantiated.
    In other words, router `carmacks-router` is indeed in front of network `carmacks`.

    > Then, try a more exhaustive search approach:
    >

    > $ for i in $(openstack router list -f value -c Name); do

    > done
    >

    > Checking router router-{{api_region|lower}}
    > ```

## Tearing down networks

Now that you know you're dealing with a full-blown network and a router, you start by disconnecting the subnet from the router.
Then, you will move on to deleting the subnet and the network, and after that, you can finish up with deleting the router.

=== "{{gui}}"
    Go to the _Subnets_ tab of the `carmacks` network, and click the gray notepad-and-pen icon (at the left of the red circle-with-trashcan icon).

    ![Network subnets](assets/del-net/shot-03.png)

    A vertical pane titled _Modify Subnet_ will slide over from the right-hand side of the page. Pay attention to the _Router Connections_ section.
    You will notice an active connection to the router.
    Click the red circle-with-line-over-chainlink icon to deactivate the connection, effectively disconnecting the subnet from the router.

    ![Disconnect subnet](assets/del-net/shot-04.png)

    A pop-up window will appear, asking if you really want to go ahead with the disconnection.
    Just click the red _Yes, Remove interface_ button.

    ![Remove interface](assets/del-net/shot-05.png)

    After disconnecting the subnet, click the red circle-and-trashcan icon to delete it.
    Once more, a pop-up will appear asking for confirmation.
    Click the red _Yes, Delete_ button.

    ![Delete subnet](assets/del-net/shot-06.png)

    As soon as you delete the subnet, in the _Subnets_ tab you will see the message _No subnets found_.

    ![No subnets](assets/del-net/shot-07.png)

    You can now delete the network.
    Click the three-dot icon (right-hand side of the network row) and select _Delete Network_.

    ![Delete Carmacks](assets/del-net/shot-08.png)

    Of course, you will have to confirm this action.
    Clicking the red _Yes, Delete_ button is enough.

    ![Confirm network delete](assets/del-net/shot-09.png)

    After deleting the network, it will not be on the list of all available networks.

    ![List of networks](assets/del-net/shot-10.png)

    There's still that router lying around, and if you have no use for it, go to the _Routers_ page to delete it.
    In the vertical pane on the left, expand the _Networking_ section and click on _Routers_.
    In the central pane of the page, you will see all routers in all regions you have access to.

    ![All routers](assets/del-net/shot-11.png)

    Click the red three-dot icon of the router you wish to delete and select _Delete Router_.
    A pop-up will appear asking for confirmation, so click the red _Yes, Delete_ button.

    ![Confirm router delete](assets/del-net/shot-12.png)

    After successfully deleting the router, there will be no trace of it in the list of all routers.

    ![Router is gone](assets/del-net/shot-13.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    First, take a look at all available subnets:

    ```console
    $ openstack subnet list

    +-------------------------------+-----------------+--------------------------------+---------------+
    | ID                            | Name            | Network                        | Subnet        |
    +-------------------------------+-----------------+--------------------------------+---------------+
    | 421d8fd2-dd7f-4f7c-9a51-      | subnet-{{api_region|lower}}     | e0c4ce17-2722-4777-8140-       | 10.15.20.0/24 |
    | 42ef4a866dd9                  |                 | d6c87479e190                   |               |
    | 7fa9e5a2-7d5a-466e-b120-      | carmacks-subnet | cb0a298a-bbb6-4ad6-832a-       | 10.1.0.0/24   |
    | 7d2bffb99ce5                  |                 | 1456dafe45db                   |               |
    | bd1d0ff2-7270-4a9a-a7ad-      | teslin-subnet   | 9b127d2c-01d7-4803-994f-       | 10.254.0.0/24 |
    | fff47e997e7b                  |                 | f88292870c1d                   |               |
    +-------------------------------+-----------------+--------------------------------+---------------+
    ```

    As you would expect, included on the list is subnet `carmacks-subnet`, which you are about to delete.
    That's easier said than done, though:

    ```console
    $ openstack subnet delete $SUBNET_ID

    Failed to delete subnet with name or ID '7fa9e5a2-7d5a-466e-b120-7d2bffb99ce5': ConflictException: 409:
    Client Error for url: {{api_region|lower}}.{{api_domain}}:9696/v2.0/subnets/7fa9e5a2-7d5a-466e-b120-7d2bffb99ce5,
    Unable to complete operation on subnet 7fa9e5a2-7d5a-466e-b120-7d2bffb99ce5:
    One or more ports have an IP allocation from this subnet.
    1 of 1 subnets failed to delete.
    ```

    The trick here is to first disconnect the subnet from the corresponding router, which is perfectly doable from the side of the router.
    As we discovered a bit earlier, the router we are talking about is `carmacks-router`:

    ```bash
    openstack router remove subnet carmacks-router $SUBNET_ID
    ```

    If the command above is successful, you will see no output on your terminal.
    Now, an attempt to delete `carmacks-subnet` should go through with flying colors:

    ```bash
    openstack subnet delete $SUBNET_ID
    ```

    Again, no command output means success, but we suggest you check yourself:

    ```console
    $ openstack subnet list

    +--------------------------------+---------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
    | ID                             | Name          | Network                         | Subnet        |
    +--------------------------------+---------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
    | 421d8fd2-dd7f-4f7c-9a51-       | subnet-{{api_region|lower}}   | e0c4ce17-2722-4777-8140-        | 10.15.20.0/24 |
    | 42ef4a866dd9                   |               | d6c87479e190                    |               |
    | bd1d0ff2-7270-4a9a-a7ad-       | teslin-subnet | 9b127d2c-01d7-4803-994f-        | 10.254.0.0/24 |
    | fff47e997e7b                   |               | f88292870c1d                    |               |
    +--------------------------------+---------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
    ```

    The subnet `carmacks-subnet` is not on the list, which is what you wanted exactly.
    Next is network `carmacks`, which you should be able to delete by now.
    First, take a look at all available networks:

    ```console
    $ openstack network list --internal

    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    | ID                                   | Name         | Subnets                              |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    | 1f94d315-7ca1-4d44-acc1-09c6c650df74 | mayo         |                                      |
    | 9b127d2c-01d7-4803-994f-f88292870c1d | teslin       | bd1d0ff2-7270-4a9a-a7ad-fff47e997e7b |
    | cb0a298a-bbb6-4ad6-832a-1456dafe45db | carmacks     |                                      |
    | e0c4ce17-2722-4777-8140-d6c87479e190 | network-{{api_region|lower}} | 421d8fd2-dd7f-4f7c-9a51-42ef4a866dd9 |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

    Network `carmacks` is on the list, and by looking at the `Subnets` column, you see that it has no subnet.
    That's expected, so go ahead and delete the network:

    ```bash
    openstack network delete carmacks
    ```

    No command output signals success, but it never hurts to verify yourself:

    ```console
    $ openstack network list --internal

    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    | ID                                   | Name         | Subnets                              |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    | 1f94d315-7ca1-4d44-acc1-09c6c650df74 | mayo         |                                      |
    | 9b127d2c-01d7-4803-994f-f88292870c1d | teslin       | bd1d0ff2-7270-4a9a-a7ad-fff47e997e7b |
    | e0c4ce17-2722-4777-8140-d6c87479e190 | network-{{api_region|lower}} | 421d8fd2-dd7f-4f7c-9a51-42ef4a866dd9 |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

    Network `carmacks` is gone, and if you have no use of `carmacks-router`, go ahead and delete it:

    ```bash
    openstack router delete carmacks-router
    ```

    There is no output on the terminal, and yet the router is gone:

    ```console
    $ openstack router list

## Networks with a subnet but no router

These are faster to delete, for there is no router to disconnect the subnet from.
For our demonstration, we created network `teslin`, with subnet `teslin-subnet` and no router in front of it.

=== "{{gui}}"
    In the vertical pane on the left-hand side of the dashboard, expand the _Networking_ section and click _Networks_.
    In the central pane of the page, you will see all networks in all regions you have access to.
    Select a network with a subnet and no router --- like `teslin` in our example.

    Looking at the network details, it is immediately apparent that there's no router in front of it.

    ![No router in sight](assets/del-net/shot-14.png)

    Go to the _Subnets_ tab, and click the red circle-with-trashcan icon to delete the subnet.

    ![Delete subnet](assets/del-net/shot-15.png)

    Then, click the red three-dot icon at the right-hand side of the `teslin` row, and select _Delete Network_.

=== "OpenStack CLI"
    Let us first take a look at all available networks...

    ```console
    $ openstack network list --internal

    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    | ID                                   | Name         | Subnets                              |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    | 1f94d315-7ca1-4d44-acc1-09c6c650df74 | mayo         |                                      |
    | 9b127d2c-01d7-4803-994f-f88292870c1d | teslin       | bd1d0ff2-7270-4a9a-a7ad-fff47e997e7b |
    | e0c4ce17-2722-4777-8140-d6c87479e190 | network-{{api_region|lower}} | 421d8fd2-dd7f-4f7c-9a51-42ef4a866dd9 |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

    ...and at all available subnets:

    ```console
    $ openstack subnet list

    +--------------------------------+---------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
    | ID                             | Name          | Network                         | Subnet        |
    +--------------------------------+---------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
    | 421d8fd2-dd7f-4f7c-9a51-       | subnet-{{api_region|lower}}   | e0c4ce17-2722-4777-8140-        | 10.15.20.0/24 |
    | 42ef4a866dd9                   |               | d6c87479e190                    |               |
    | bd1d0ff2-7270-4a9a-a7ad-       | teslin-subnet | 9b127d2c-01d7-4803-994f-        | 10.254.0.0/24 |
    | fff47e997e7b                   |               | f88292870c1d                    |               |
    +--------------------------------+---------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
    ```

    Since there is nothing to disconnect the `teslin-subnet` from, you may go ahead and delete the subnet:

    ```bash
    openstack subnet delete teslin-subnet
    ```

    There is no command output.
    This is expected, but why not check yourself?

    ```console
    $ openstack subnet list

    +---------------------------------+-------------+----------------------------------+---------------+
    | ID                              | Name        | Network                          | Subnet        |
    +---------------------------------+-------------+----------------------------------+---------------+
    | 421d8fd2-dd7f-4f7c-9a51-        | subnet-{{api_region|lower}} | e0c4ce17-2722-4777-8140-         | 10.15.20.0/24 |
    | 42ef4a866dd9                    |             | d6c87479e190                     |               |
    +---------------------------------+-------------+----------------------------------+---------------+
    ```

    Finally, network `teslin` can go away with a single command:

    ```bash
    openstack network delete teslin
    ```

    The absence of any output means the command was successful.
    Take a look yourself:

    ```console
    $ openstack network list --internal

    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    | ID                                   | Name         | Subnets                              |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    | 1f94d315-7ca1-4d44-acc1-09c6c650df74 | mayo         |                                      |
    | e0c4ce17-2722-4777-8140-d6c87479e190 | network-{{api_region|lower}} | 421d8fd2-dd7f-4f7c-9a51-42ef4a866dd9 |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

## Networks with no subnet and no router

You may directly, without the slightest preparation, delete networks like these.
For our demonstration, we created a network named `mayo`, with no subnet and no router in front of it.

=== "{{gui}}"
    While viewing all available networks, click the red three-dot icon at the right-hand side of the `mayo` row and select _Delete Network_.
    You will have to confirm the action, and the network will be gone as soon as you do.

    ![Delete Mayo](assets/del-net/shot-17.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    Once more, take a look at all remaining networks:

    ```console
    $ openstack network list --internal

    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    | ID                                   | Name         | Subnets                              |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    | 1f94d315-7ca1-4d44-acc1-09c6c650df74 | mayo         |                                      |
    | e0c4ce17-2722-4777-8140-d6c87479e190 | network-{{api_region|lower}} | 421d8fd2-dd7f-4f7c-9a51-42ef4a866dd9 |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

    Since `mayo` has no subnet, issue a single command to delete it:

    ```bash
    openstack network delete mayo
    ```

    And, yes, it is still a good idea to check yourself:

    ```console
    $ openstack network list --internal

    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    | ID                                   | Name         | Subnets                              |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    | e0c4ce17-2722-4777-8140-d6c87479e190 | network-{{api_region|lower}} | 421d8fd2-dd7f-4f7c-9a51-42ef4a866dd9 |
    +--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

## Recap: Of networks and towns

Depending on the features of a Neutron network, deleting it may require some preparation work.
For the purposes of this guide, we created three different networks with different characteristics; `carmacks`, `teslin`, and `mayo`.
Then, either from the {{gui}} or with the help of OpenStack CLI, we showed how we discover any component dependencies and how we work towards deletion.
Eventually, all three test networks were gone.
We should point out, though, that all three namesake towns in Yukon are still there.
