# Creating new networks

Before creating a server in {{brand}}, you need at least one network to make the new server a member of.
Since you may have more than one network per region, let us now walk through creating a new network using the {{gui}} or the OpenStack CLI.

## Prerequisites

Whether you choose to work from the {{gui}} or with the OpenStack CLI, you need to [have an account](../../getting-started/create-account.md) in {{brand}}.
Additionally, to use the OpenStack CLI make sure to [enable it first](../../getting-started/enable-openstack-cli.md).

## Creating a network

To create a network from the {{gui}}, fire up your favorite web browser, navigate to the [Cleura Cloud](https://{{gui_domain}}) start page, and login into your {{brand}} account.
On the other hand, if you prefer to work with OpenStack CLI, please do not forget to source the RC file first.

=== "{{gui}}"
    On the top right-hand side of the {{gui}}, click the _Create_ button.
    A new pane will slide into view from the right-hand side of the browser window, titled _Create_.

    ![Create a new object](assets/new-net-panel/shot-01.png)

    You will notice several rounded boxes prominently displayed on that pane, each for defining, configuring, and instantiating a different {{brand}} object.
    Go ahead and click the _Network_ box.
    A new pane titled _Create Network_ will slide over.
    At the top, type in a name and select one of the available regions for the new network.

=== "OpenStack CLI"
    Start by creating a new network.
    In our example, let's name it `nordostbahnhof`:

    ```bash
    openstack network create nordostbahnhof
    ```

    After issuing the command above, you immediately get information regarding the new network:

## Adding a subnet and a router

Creating a new network does not necessarily mean it has all the features you most likely would expect.
Unless you work from the {{gui}}, where almost every component is activated for you with a few clicks here and there, when you use the OpenStack CLI there is some extra work you need to do before you get a network you would characterize as useful.

=== "{{gui}}"
    Expand the _Advanced Options_ section below, make sure _Port Security_ is enabled, and leave the MTU parameter blank.

    ![MTU and port security](assets/new-net-panel/shot-03.png)

    Assuming you are going for a full-featured network, activate the _Create a complete network, containing a subnet and a router_ option.

    Notice that, by default, this sets things up for the the creation of an IPv4-based subnet.
    In particular, by looking at the new _Subnet Name (#1)_ section, it is immediately apparent that you get the following:

    - A subnet expressed in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation),
    - two DNS servers,
    - a Gateway, and
    - a DHCP server.

    For the _Gateway IP_, accept the suggested address, or type in one chosen from the subnet above.
    As for the DHCP, either accept the defaults or type in _Start_ and _End_ addresses -- again chosen from the subnet above.
    
    ![IPv4-based network parameters](assets/new-net-panel/shot-04.png)

    Alongside your IPv4-based subnet, you may also have an IPv6-based subnet;
    both subnets will be members of the network you are now creating.
    
    To create a second, IPv6-based subnet, click the orange :fontawesome-solid-circle-plus: icon at the top of the _Subnet Name (#1)_ section.
    In the new _Subnet Name (#2)_ section that appears, be sure to set _IP Version_ to _IPv6_ abd you will get the following:

    - One 64bit-prefixed subnet with
    - SLAAC addressing, and
    - two DNS servers with IPv6 addresses.

    ![IPv6-based network parameters](assets/new-net-panel/shot-04-toronto.png)

    Scroll down a bit if you have to.
    Assuming you want your cloud servers to reach hosts on the Internet, for the _External network_ parameter make sure you select _ext-net_.
    Then, click the green _Create_ button.
    In a few seconds, the new network will be readily available.

    ![Finish creating network](assets/new-net-panel/shot-05.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    You now have to create a subnet for the new network.
    Since Neutron networks can have more than one subnets, and subnets can be either IPv4-based or IPv6-based, let us now create two;
    one IPv4-based (`nordostbahnhof-subnet-ipv4`), and one IPv4-based (`nordostbahnhof-subnet-ipv6`).

    For the IPv4-based subnet, type the following:

    ```bash
    openstack subnet create nordostbahnhof-subnet-ipv4 \
        --network nordostbahnhof --subnet-range 10.20.30.0/24
    ```

    You will get detailed information regarding subnet `nordostbahnhof-subnet-ipv4`:

    If you want servers connected to the `nordostbahnhof` network to have Internet access, you need a router in front of the network.
    Following our unofficial naming convention, go ahead and create a new router called `nordostbahnhof-router`:

    ```bash
    openstack router create nordostbahnhof-router 
    ```

    As expected, you will see lots of information regarding the new router:

    ```

    You want the `nordostbahnhof-router` connected to the external network.
    The name of this network is `ext-net`:

    ```bash
    openstack router set nordostbahnhof-router --external-gateway ext-net
    ```

    Please note that if the command above is successful, you will get no output on your terminal.
    There is one last step to take, and that is to connect router `nordostbahnhof-router` to the subnet `nordostbahnhof-subnet-ipv4`...

    ```bash
    openstack router add subnet nordostbahnhof-router nordostbahnhof-subnet-ipv4
    ```

    ...and to the subnet `nordostbahnhof-subnet-ipv6` of network `nordostbahnhof`:

    ```bash
    openstack router add subnet nordostbahnhof-router nordostbahnhof-subnet-ipv6
    ```

    Again, if the commands above are successful, you will get no output.

## Listing networks and getting information

At any time, you may connect to the {{gui}}, list all networks you have already created, and get detailed information for any of these networks.
Alternatively, you may get all that information using the OpenStack CLI.

=== "{{gui}}"
    You may see all defined networks, in all supported regions, by selecting _Networking_ > _Networks_ (see the left-hand side pane on the {{gui}}).

    ![All networks in all regions](assets/new-net-panel/shot-06.png)

    For more information regarding a specific network, select _View details_.
    Then, you can glance over all the details regarding the selected network's ports, subnets, and routers.
    For more information on the network subnets specifically, in the left-hand side pane on the {{gui}} select _Networking_ > _Subnets_.

    ![Network details](assets/new-net-panel/shot-07.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    To list all available networks in a specific region, just type:

    ```console
    $ openstack network list
    +--------------------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+
    | ID                                   | Name           | Subnets                              |
    +--------------------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+
    ...
    | 688996ba-7a77-4d6e-9630-34cd234abbcd | nordostbahnhof | fc983984-2d6c-4cf4-a147-a7672da1d6b8 |
    ...
    | efb30531-a65a-4890-8b3c-56a503b51637 | ext-net        | ee961be4-0555-4e8c-a2fa-7ba521193714 |
    +--------------------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

    You can always ask for more specific results.
    For instance, to see all internal networks only, type the following:

    ```console
    $ openstack network list --internal
    +--------------------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+
    | ID                                   | Name           | Subnets                              |
    +--------------------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+
    | 1900d6fd-040a-41d4-bb8c-7352f199e143 | test-network   | 5c89208a-eb44-4d25-982b-64f6df0a2549 |
    | 688996ba-7a77-4d6e-9630-34cd234abbcd | nordostbahnhof | fc983984-2d6c-4cf4-a147-a7672da1d6b8 |
    +--------------------------------------+----------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

    You can also get detailed information about a specific network:

    ```console
    $ openstack network show nordostbahnhof
