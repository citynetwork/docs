# Restoring a server to a snapshot

Servers in {{brand}} that have the [disaster recovery](../../../background/disaster-recovery.md) feature enabled can go back in time, meaning you may restore such a server to one of the available point-in-time snapshots.
Here is how you can do that.

## How to restore, step by step

To select a particular snapshot and restore your server to it, first off, navigate to the {{gui}}.
From the left-hand side vertical pane, choose Compute â†’ [Servers](https://{{gui_domain}}/compute/servers), then expand the detailed view of the server of interest.
Select the *Disaster Recovery* tab and see all available snapshots listed below.
For each one of those, the date and creation time are visible.

Click on the snapshot you want.
A pop-up window will appear, asking for your permission to proceed.
Make sure this is indeed the snapshot you want, then click the red button labeled *Yes, Restore snapshot*.

The restore process will begin immediately.
You can tell it is progressing by checking the status.

As soon as the snapshot is ready to be used, you will see a message indicating that it has started.
Do not forget to activate the server; click on its row to select it, then click the :fontawesome-solid-play: button above.
