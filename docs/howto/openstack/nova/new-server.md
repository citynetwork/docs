# Creating new servers

Once you have an [account in
{{brand}}](../../getting-started/create-account.md), you can create
virtual machines --- henceforth simply _servers_ --- using either the
{{gui}} or the OpenStack CLI. Let us demonstrate the creation of a new
server, following both approaches.

## Prerequisites

You need to [have at least one
network](../neutron/new-network.md) in the region you are
interested in. Additionally, if you prefer to work with the OpenStack
CLI, then make sure to properly [enable it
first](../../getting-started/enable-openstack-cli.md).

## Creating a server

To create a server from the {{gui}}, fire up your favorite web
browser, navigate to the [{{gui}}](https://{{gui_domain}}) start page,
and log into your {{brand}} account. On the other hand, if you prefer
to work with the OpenStack CLI, please do not forget to [source the RC
file first](../../getting-started/enable-openstack-cli.md).

=== "{{gui}}"
    On the top right-hand side of the {{gui}}, click the _Create_ button. A
    new pane titled _Create_ will slide into view from the right-hand side
    of the browser window.

    ![Create new object](assets/new-server/shot-01.png)

    You will notice several rounded boxes on that pane, each for defining,
    configuring, and instantiating a different {{brand}} object. Go ahead
    and click the _Server_ box. A new pane titled _Create a Server_ will
    slide over. At the top, type in a name for the new server and select one
    of the available regions.

    ![Create new server](assets/new-server/shot-02.png)

    Below the region selection is a drop-down menu where you must select a
    _server profile_. Currently, four profiles are available:

    *  _Generic_,
    * _High CPU_,
    * _Low Latency Disk_, and
    *  _GPU_.

    Selecting one of those gives you access to a subset of all available
    [_flavors_](../../../reference/flavors/index.md).

    As the profile names suggest, each profile but the _Generic_ points to a
    set of flavors suitable for servers intended to run specific types of
    applications:

    * The _Generic_ profile is for general-purpose cloud servers.
    * The _CPU_ profile is for servers designed to host CPU-intensive
      applications.
    * The _Low Latency Disk_ profile is for servers that boot off of a local
      low-latency disk.
    * The _GPU_ profile is for servers that boot off of a local SSD disk
      and, most importantly, have direct access to an NVIDIA vGPU.

    We should point out that not _all_ profiles may be available in any
    region. Choose the _Generic_ profile for now, which is available in any
    of the regions.

    ![Create new server](assets/new-server/shot-03.png)

    In the _Boot source_ section below, click the dropdown menu on the left
    and make sure you select _Image_, so you can choose one of the readily
    available OS images to boot the new server off of. To pick one of the
    images, click on the dropdown menu on the right. For this how-to guide,
    we have chosen _ubuntu_ in general and _Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish_ in
    particular.

    ![Boot source](assets/new-server/shot-04.png)

    Next up, notice that the _Boot Target_ is preselected for you. Depending
    on the server profile you have already selected, the boot target will be
    either _Volume_ or _Ephemeral_. More specifically...

    * for the _Generic_, _High CPU_, and _GPU_ profiles the boot target is
      _Volume_, and
    * for the _Low Latency Disk_ profile the boot target is _Ephemeral_.

    Regarding the server's CPU core count and amount of memory, set the
    [_Flavor_](../../../reference/flavors/index.md) accordingly. We suggest
    selecting a flavor that specifies a server with 1 CPU core and 1GiB of
    RAM.

    Please note that, depending on the chosen flavor, the estimated monthly
    cost of the server changes. (While a server is shut off you are still
    getting charged for it, but less so.) At any time, this estimated cost
    is displayed in the green rectangular area at the top.

    Something else that affects the cost is the size of the root device.
    Take a look at the _Volume_ parameter below, and notice the default (in
    [gibibytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte#Base_2_(binary))).
    You may leave the root device size unchanged or modify it to be a bit
    lower or higher than the default.

    When, at a later time, you decide to delete the server, you can do so
    but **keep** its boot volume (you may want, for example, to attach the
    exact same volume to a new server). Just disable the _Delete on
    termination_ option if you want this kind of flexibility. On the other
    hand, if you want your root volume to be automatically deleted when the
    server terminates, the _Delete on termination_ option is already enabled
    for you. In any case, use this option with caution.

    Finally, you may leave the _Disaster recovery_ enabled. If you do, then
    daily server snapshots will be created, and you will have the option for
    easy and fast rollups to previous snapshots. Please be aware that
    leaving this option enabled increases the server's monthly estimated
    cost (again, it is displayed in the green rectangular area at the top).

    ![Server configuration](assets/new-server/shot-05.png)

    Regarding networking, select at least one of the available (local)
    networks to attach the new server to. If you want the server to be
    accessible from the Internet, enable the _Connect a floating IP to the
    server_ option. Then, from the _Create External IP on_ drop-down menu,
    select one of the networks the server is attached to. A typical scenario
    is that the server is connected to just one local network, thus the
    external IP will be associated with that same network. In the section
    below, set _Security Groups_ to _default_ or to a security group you
    have already created.

    ![Networking and security groups](assets/new-server/shot-06.png)

    If you already have one or more key pairs in your {{brand}} account, you
    can now select a public key to be included in the
    `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file of the server's default user (for the
    image you have selected, that user would be `ubuntu`). That way, you can
    securely log into the remote user's account via SSH without typing a
    password. If there are no key pairs to choose from, activate the _Set
    password_ option and set a password for the default user account.

    ![Login and keypairs](assets/new-server/shot-07.png)

    A configuration script is automatically prepared based on the choices
    you have already made. That script runs during system boot and performs
    housekeeping tasks like user account creation, enabling acceptable
    authentication methods, and configuring remote package repositories.
    Click on _Advanced Options_ to see the default script. It is now time to
    create your {{brand}} server; click the green _Create_ button, and the
    new server will be readily available in a few seconds.

    ![Create new server](assets/new-server/shot-08.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    An `openstack` command for creating a server may look like
    this:

    ```bash
    openstack server create \
        --flavor $FLAVOR_NAME \
        --image $IMAGE_NAME \
        --boot-from-volume $VOL_SIZE \
        --network $NETWORK_NAME \
        --security-group $SEC_GROUP_NAME \
        --key-name $KEY_NAME \
        --wait \
        $SERVER_NAME
    ```

    Each variable represents a piece of information we have to look
    for or, in the cases of `KEY_NAME` and `SERVER_NAME`, arbitrarily
    define.

    Let us begin with the [_flavors_](../../../reference/flavors/index.md) (`FLAVOR_NAME`), which
    describe combinations of CPU core count and memory size. Each server has a
    distinct flavor, and to see all available flavors type:

    ```bash
    openstack flavor list
    ```

    You will get a pretty long list of flavors. For our demonstration,
    we suggest you go with `b.1c1gb`. A server with this particular flavor will
    have one CPU core and one
    [gibibyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte#Base_2_(binary)) of
    RAM. Go ahead and set `FLAVOR_NAME` accordingly:

    ```bash
    FLAVOR_NAME="b.1c1gb"
    ```

    Your server should have an image to boot off of (`IMAGE_NAME`).
    For a list of all available images in {{brand}}, type:

    ```bash
    openstack image list
    ```

    This time you get a shorter list, but you can still filter for
    images with the OS you prefer. For example, filter for Ubuntu:

    ```bash
    openstack image list --tag "os:ubuntu"
    ```

    Continue with the `Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish 20220810` image:

    ```bash
    IMAGE_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish 20220810"
    ```

    Before you go on, decide on the capacity (in gibibytes) of the server's
    boot volume (`VOL_SIZE`). We suggest you start with 20 gibibytes:

    ```bash
    VOL_SIZE="20"
    ```

    You need at least one network in the region you're about to
    create your new server (`NETWORK_NAME`). To get the names of all
    available (internal) networks, type:

    ```bash
    openstack network list --internal -c Name
    ```

    ```plain
    +----------------+
    | Name           |
    +----------------+
    | nordostbahnhof |
    +----------------+
    ```

    Set the `NETWORK_NAME` variable accordingly:

    ```bash
    NETWORK_NAME="nordostbahnhof"
    ```

    Regarding the security group (`SEC_GROUP_NAME`), unless you
    have already created one yourself, you will find only one per region:

    ```bash
    openstack security group list -c Name -c Description
    ```

    ```plain
    +---------+------------------------+
    | Name    | Description            |
    +---------+------------------------+
    | default | Default security group |
    +---------+------------------------+
    ```

    Go ahead and set `SEC_GROUP_NAME`:

    ```bash
    SEC_GROUP_NAME="default"
    ```

    You most likely want a server you can remotely connect to via
    SSH without typing a password. Upload one of our public keys to your
    {{brand}} account:

    ```bash
    openstack keypair create --public-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub bahnhof
    ```

    In the example above, we uploaded the public key
    `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to our {{brand}} account and named
    it `bahnhof`. Follow our example, and do not forget to set the
    `KEY_NAME`:

    ```bash
    KEY_NAME="bahnhof"
    ```

    By the way, check all uploaded public keys...

    ```bash
    openstack keypair list
    ```

    ...and get more information regarding the one you just uploaded:

    ```bash
    openstack keypair show bahnhof
    ```

    You are almost ready to create your new server. Decide on a
    name...

    ```bash
    SERVER_NAME="zug" # just an example
    ```

    ...and then go ahead and create it:

    ```bash
    openstack server create \
        --flavor b.1c1gb \
        --image $IMAGE_NAME \
        --boot-from-volume 20 \
        --network nordostbahnhof \
        --security-group default \
        --key-name bahnhof \
        --wait \
        zug
    ```

    (For clarity's sake, and with the exception of `IMAGE_NAME`, we
    used the actual values and not the variables we so meticulously set.)
    The `--wait` parameter is optional. Whenever you choose to
    use it, you get back control of your terminal only after the server is
    readily available in {{brand}}.

    To connect to your server remotely, you need to create a floating IP
    for the external network in the {{brand}}, and then assign
    this IP to your server. First, create the floating IP:

    ```bash
    openstack floating ip create ext-net
    ```

    See all floating IPs...

    ```bash
    openstack floating ip list
    ```

    ...and assign the one you just created to your server:

    ```bash
    openstack server add floating ip zug 198.51.100.12
    ```

    The username of the default user account in the Ubuntu image is
    `ubuntu`, so now you can connect to your remote server via SSH without
    typing a password:

    ```bash
    ssh ubuntu@198.51.100.12
    ```

    Alternatively, you may also use the following command, which is more flexible though slightly longer:

    ```bash
    openstack server ssh --public zug -- -l ubuntu
    ```

## Viewing information about the newly created server
=== "{{gui}}"
    At any time, from the {{gui}} you may see all servers, and get detailed
    information regarding each one of them; expand the left-hand side
    vertical pane, click _Compute_, then _Servers_, and, in the central
    pane, select the region you want.

    ![Servers and details](assets/new-server/shot-09.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    To see all available servers in the region, type:

    ```bash
    openstack server list
    ```

    You can always get specific information on a particular server:

    ```bash
    openstack server show zug
    ```
## Connecting to the server console
=== "{{gui}}"
    While viewing information regarding your server, you may get its public
    IP  address (e.g., from the _Addresses_ tab) and connect to it remotely
    via SSH. Alternatively, you may launch a web console and log in; click
    on the three-dot icon on the right of the server header, and from the
    pop-up menu that appears select _Remote Console_.

    ![Launch remote console](assets/new-server/shot-10.png)

    A new window pops up, and that's your web console to your {{brand}}
    server. Please note that this window cannot be resized but can be opened
    in a new browser window or tab.

    ![Server console](assets/new-server/shot-11.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    You may have access to the web console of your server, and you need the
    corresponding URL for it:

    ```bash
    openstack console url show zug
    ```

    Usage of the web console is discouraged, though. Instead,
    securely connect to your server via SSH.
