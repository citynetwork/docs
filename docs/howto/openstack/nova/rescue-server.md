# Rescuing a server

This guide will walk you through the required steps to access a server in [rescue mode](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/user/rescue.html) when you need to.

You can use rescue mode to access the server’s operating system disk to fix a corrupted file system, reset access credentials on the server, and do other emergency recovery tasks.


## Prerequisites

You need to have previously [created a server](new-server.md) that you now wish to rescue.
Additionally, if you prefer to work with the OpenStack CLI, then make sure to properly [enable it first](../../getting-started/enable-openstack-cli.md).


## Initiating the rescue

=== "{{gui}}"
    Navigate to the server list.

    ![The left hand side navigation panel, with the word "Servers" highlighted.](assets/rescue-server/01-left-side-panel.png)

    Find the server you want to rescue in the list, and on the right-hand side, click on its menu button.

    ![An orange circle with three white dots.](assets/rescue-server/02-menu-button.png)

    Click on _Rescue Server_.

    ![A list of server actions, with the line "Rescue Server" highlighted.](assets/rescue-server/03-menu-list.png)

    Once selected, the rescue dialog appears.
    Leave the default option, _Use System Rescue Image_.

    Click _No_ to cancel or _Rescue_ to proceed.

    When a server has been switched to rescue mode, its status icon appears with an exclamation mark:

=== "OpenStack CLI"
    You must first select a system rescue image from the available images:

    ```console
    $ openstack image list --tag system-rescue
    +--------------------------------------+---------------+--------+
    | ID                                   | Name          | Status |
    +--------------------------------------+---------------+--------+
    | cb2217f3-1ca7-4440-b10e-df7ff2d92cae | system-rescue | active |
    +--------------------------------------+---------------+--------+
    ```

    To start the server using the system rescue image, use the following command, substituting the correct ID for the `system-rescue` image in your {{brand}} region:

    ```bash
    openstack --os-compute-api-version 2.87 \
      server rescue \
      --image cb2217f3-1ca7-4440-b10e-df7ff2d92cae <server_id>
    ```

    While the rescue is ongoing, the server should have the `OS-EXT-STS:vm_state` of `rescued` and the `status` of `RESCUE`.

    ```console
    $ openstack server show -v OS-EXT-STS:vm_state -c status <server_id>
    +---------------------+---------+
    | Field               | Value   |
    +---------------------+---------+
    | OS-EXT-STS:vm_state | rescued |
    | status              | RESCUE  |
    +---------------------+---------+
    ```

## Accessing the server in rescue mode

You can now proceed to accessing the remote console of your server, [as you would with any other newly launched server](new-server.md#connecting-to-the-server-console).

Please refer to the [System Rescue documentation](https://www.system-rescue.org/manual/) documentation for details on the available tools and features bundled with System Rescue.
