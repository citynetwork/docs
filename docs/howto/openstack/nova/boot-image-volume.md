# Converting a boot-from-image server to boot-from-volume

You can freely move any server [between {{brand}} regions](move-server-between-regions.md), provided it boots from a volume (which we generally recommend, since it affords more flexibility than booting from an image).
You may still have boot-from-image servers, though.
To verify that a particular server is of that type, you can go to the {{gui}}, locate the server, and expand its detailed view.
Go to the *Details* tab and pay attention to the *Boot Target* field.
If this is a boot-from-image server, it says *Ephemeral Disk*.

Whenever you decide to move a boot-from-image server between regions, you will discover that you cannot do so.
The solution is first to convert it to a boot-from-volume server and then move it.
In the following, we show how to perform the conversion using the {{gui}} or the OpenStack CLI.

## Preparation

=== "{{gui}}"
    Fire up your favorite web browser and navigate to the [{{gui}}](https://{{gui_domain}}) start page.
    Log into your {{brand}} account if you have to.
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    To work with the OpenStack CLI, make sure to properly [enable it](../../getting-started/enable-openstack-cli.md) for the region your boot-from-image server resides in.

## Shutting down the server

=== "{{gui}}"
    Make sure the left-hand side vertical pane is in full view, then select *Compute* → [*Servers*](https://{{gui_domain}}/compute/servers).
    You will see all supported {{brand}} regions in the main pane.
    Expand the one with the boot-from-image server you want to convert to boot-from-volume.
    Click the orange three-dots-in-a-circle icon at the right of the server row, and from the pop-up menu that appears, select *Stop Server*.

    ![Stopping server](assets/bfi-to-bfv/shot01.png)

    A pop-up window appears, asking if you want to stop the server.
    Confirm by clicking on the red button labeled *Yes, Stop*.
    
    ![Confirming server shutdown](assets/bfi-to-bfv/are-you-really-really-sure.png) 
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    Assuming your boot-from-image server is named [`nanisivik`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanisivik), using your favorite terminal application, shut it down by typing the following:

    ```bash
    openstack server stop nanisivik
    ```

    To confirm that it has finished shutting down, type:

    ```bash
    openstack server show nanisivik -c status -f value
    ```

    You should see this:

    ```plain
    SHUTOFF
    ```

## Taking a snapshot

=== "{{gui}}"
    When the server is shut off, click on its row to get the detailed view and go to the *Snapshots* tab.
    There, click the green button labeled *Create a Snapshot*.

    ![Creating a snapshot](assets/bfi-to-bfv/shot02.png)

    A pop-up window appears, where you have to type in a name for the snapshot.
    You must also be explicit regarding the operation you are about to perform, by activating the switch at the left of the corresponding question.
    When you are ready, click the green button labeled *Create*.

    ![Confirming snapshot creation](assets/bfi-to-bfv/shot03.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    To take a snapshot of the server, all you have to do is type something like the following:

    ```console
    $ openstack server image create --name nanisivik_snap nanisivik

    +------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    ```

    At first, the status of the snapshot is `queued`.
    To make sure the snapshot has been successfully created, type:

    ```bash
    openstack image show nanisivik_snap -c status -f value
    ```

    You should see this:

    ```plain
    active
    ```

## Creating a volume from the snapshot

=== "{{gui}}"
    After a few seconds, the snapshot will be created and listed in the *Snapshots* tab.
    Before you proceed, take note of its size.
    At the right-hand side of the snapshot row, click the :fontawesome-solid-database: icon to create a new volume off of the snapshot you just created.

    ![Creating volume from snapshot](assets/bfi-to-bfv/shot04.png)

    A new vertical pane will slide over from the right-hand side of the {{gui}}.
    Type in a name for the new volume, and choose a volume size **bigger** than the snapshot size.
    Then, you need to type in a description regarding the new volume.

    ![Typing in name, size, and description](assets/bfi-to-bfv/shot05.png)

    Scroll down a bit if you have to, and click the green *Create* button.

    ![Starting volume creation](assets/bfi-to-bfv/shot06.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    Before creating a volume off of the snapshot you just created, jot down its size like this:

    ```bash
    openstack image show nanisivik_snap -c min_disk -f value
    ```

    In our example, the size of the snapshot is `50` [gibibytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte#Base_2_(binary)).
    Now, go ahead and create a volume slightly larger than the size of the snapshot:

    ```console
    $ openstack volume create --size 56 --image nanisivik_snap nanisivik_vol

    | source_volid        | None                                 |
    | status              | creating                             |

    +---------------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

    As you can see in the example above, we named our volume `nanisivik_vol`, and its `status` was at first `creating`.
    You may check the progress of this operation by typing this:

    ```bash
    openstack volume show nanisivik_vol -c status -f value
    ```

    As soon as the new volume is ready, the `status` becomes `available`.

## Viewing the new volume

=== "{{gui}}"
    In the left-hand side vertical pane, select *Storage* → [*Volumes*](https://{{gui_domain}}/storage/volumes).
    In the main pane, select the region your boot-from-image server resides in.
    You will see the volume you created in the previous step.
    In the intersection of the volume row and the column labeled *Attached To*, it will say *-No attachments-*.
    That is expected.

## Deleting the boot-from-image server

=== "{{gui}}"
    Go to the servers view by selecting *Compute* → [*Servers*](https://{{gui_domain}}/compute/servers), and locate the boot-from-image server.
    It is time to delete it, so click the orange three-dots-in-a-circle icon at the right of the server row, and from the pop-up menu that appears, select *Delete Server*.

    ![Deleting server](assets/bfi-to-bfv/shot08.png)

    A window titled *About to delete a server* will appear, asking you if you want to proceed with the deletion.
    Click the red button labeled *Yes, Delete*.

    ![Confirming server deletion](assets/bfi-to-bfv/shot09.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    Since you have a snapshot and a volume of your server, you can now delete it:

    ```bash
    openstack server delete nanisivik
    ```

    If the operation succeeds, you should see no output on your terminal.

## Creating a new boot-from-volume server

=== "{{gui}}"
    Now, go back to your volumes by selecting *Storage* → [*Volumes*](https://{{gui_domain}}/storage/volumes).
    Tick the volume you created a bit earlier, click the orange three-dots-in-a-circle icon at the right of the volume row, and from the pop-up menu that appears, select *Create Server*.
    A vertical pane will slide over from the right-hand side of the {{gui}}, titled *Create a Server*.

    ![Creating new server](assets/bfi-to-bfv/shot10.png)

    Type in a name for the new server.
    That could as well be the name your boot-from-image server had.
    Notice that the server region is pre-selected and the same as the one in which the volume resides.
    The boot source of the server is also pre-selected and is the volume itself.

    Scroll down a bit if you have to.
    Take notice of the *Boot Target*, which should be *Volume (Recommended)*.
    Select a flavor for the new boot-from-volume server, similar to or even the same as the flavor the boot-from-image server had.

    Consider leaving the [*Disaster recovery*](../../../background/disaster-recovery.md) option enabled, and see if you want an external IP address for the server.

    Select the *default* security group and choose a *keypair* for the server.

    To create it, click the green button labeled *Create*.

=== "OpenStack CLI"
    To create your new boot-from-volume server, which will be using the volume you got starting from the snapshot of the old boot-from-image server, type something like the following:

    ```bash
    openstack server create \
        --flavor b.2c4gb \
        --volume nanisivik_vol \
        --network network-kna1 \
        --security-group default \
        --key-name karlskrona \
        --wait \
        nanisivik
    ```

    The most important parameter in the command above is `--volume`, which is used to specify the boot volume of the server.
    Regarding server creation in general, you might want to [check the corresponding guide](new-server.md).

## Viewing the new server

=== "{{gui}}"
    In the left-hand side vertical pane, select *Compute* → [*Servers*](https://{{gui_domain}}/compute/servers).
    In the main pane of the {{gui}}, go to the region the new server resides, select it and click on its row to see all its characteristics.
    In the *Details* tab, you will notice, among other things, that it has one attached volume;
    that would be the one you created from the snapshot you created from the old boot-from-image server.

=== "OpenStack CLI"
    You may see all details regarding the new boot-from-volume server, by typing something like the following:

    ```console
    $ openstack server show nanisivik

    ```

    Pay attention to the value of the `image` field, which confirms that this is indeed a boot-from-volume server.
