# Managing a Kubernetes cluster

Once you [have launched a new cluster](new-k8s-cluster.md), you can interact with it using `kubectl` and a [kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) file.

## Prerequisites

You must install the Kubernetes command line tool, `kubectl`, on your local computer, and run commands against your cluster.
To install `kubectl`, follow [the relevant Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

## Extracting the kubeconfig file

Due to Magnum's security policy configuration, you cannot use the OpenStack CLI for downloading the kubeconfig of a cluster that was created with {{gui}}, or vice versa.

To fetch your kubeconfig, you must always use the same facility that you used to deploy the cluster.

=== "{{gui}}"
    In the left-hand side pane of the {{gui}}, select *Magnum* â†’ *Clusters*.
    Click on the cluster row to expand the details view, then click the *KubeConfig* tab.
    In a second or two, you will see the contents of the kubeconfig file.
    Click the blue *Download KubeConfig* button to download it locally.

    The kubeconfig file you get has a name similar to this one:

    ```plain
    kubeconfig--<cluster_name>--<region_name>--<alphanum_id>.yaml
    ```

    Feel free to rename it to something simpler, like `config`.
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    To download the kubeconfig file for your Kubernetes cluster, type the following:

    ```bash
    openstack coe cluster config --dir=${PWD} <cluster-name>
    ```

After saving the kubeconfig file locally, set the value of variable `KUBECONFIG` to the full path of the file.
Type, for example:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=${PWD}/config
```

If you are currently managing only one cluster, and you already have its kubeconfig file stored as `~/.kube/config`, then you do not need to set the `KUBECONFIG` variable.

## Accessing the Kubernetes cluster with kubectl

You may now use `kubectl` to run commands against your cluster.
See, for instance, all cluster nodes...

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

```plain
NAME                           STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
bangor-id6nijycp2wy-master-0   Ready    master   113m   v1.18.6
bangor-id6nijycp2wy-node-0     Ready    <none>   111m   v1.18.6
```

...or all running pods in every namespace:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

```plain
NAMESPACE     NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

## Defining a default storage class

An OpenStack Magnum-managed cluster does not automatically define a default [storage class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) for [dynamic volume provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/).
You should define one immediately upon cluster creation.

To do so, create a file named `storageclass.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: csi-sc-cinderplugin
  annotations:
    "storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class": "true"
provisioner: cinder.csi.openstack.org
```

You can use an alternate `name` if you prefer.

Then, apply the storage class definition:

```console
$ kubectl apply -f storageclass.yaml
storageclass.storage.k8s.io/csi-sc-cinderplugin created
```

Subsequently, any persistent volume claims will default to using this storage class, unless you choose to [override](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/#using-dynamic-provisioning) the default by setting the `spec.storageClassName` property.
