# Setting up a TCP load balancer

Octavia is a Load Balancer as a Service (LBaaS) solution designed to
work with OpenStack. In this guide, we show how to instantiate and
configure a simple TCP load balancer in {{brand}}. All intermediate
steps are presented and explained through a specific scenario, and we
work using either the {{gui}} or the OpenStack CLI.

## Prerequisites

Whether you choose the {{gui}} or the OpenStack CLI, you need to [have
an account](../../getting-started/create-account.md) in {{brand}}.
Additionally, to use the OpenStack CLI, make sure to [enable
it](../../getting-started/enable-openstack-cli.md) for the region you
will be working in. Besides the Python `openstackclient` module, you
will also have to install the Python `octaviaclient` module. For that,
use either the package manager of your operating system or `pip`:

=== "Debian/Ubuntu"
    ```bash
    apt install python3-octaviaclient
    ```
=== "Mac OS X with Homebrew"
    This particular Python module is unavailable via `brew`, but you
    can install it via `pip`.
=== "Python Package"
    ```bash
    pip install python-octaviaclient
    ```

## Scenario and terminology

To configure and test our basic TCP load balancer, we have two servers
in the same {{brand}} region, both having `ncat` listening on port
61234/TCP and returning a greeting to clients asking to connect to that
port. Both servers are in the same internal network, and our load
balancer will be responsible for redirecting client connections to them
in a round-robin fashion. The load balancer will have a single floating
IP address, so prospective clients will have to know only that address
and not any of the backend server addresses.

> Please note that while working with your load balancer, you will
encounter some technical terms which go a long way toward
conceptualizing the inner logic of the whole LBaaS system. This guide
introduces those terms not beforehand but exactly when needed.

## Creating a load balancer

That is only the first step towards our goal, which is to have a fully
functional TCP load balancer. We will also need a listener and a pool,
but first things first.

=== "{{gui}}"
    Fire up your favorite web browser, navigate to the
    [{{gui}}](https://{{gui_domain}}) start page, and log into your
    {{brand}} account. On the top right-hand side of the {{gui}}, click the
    _Create_ button. A new pane titled _Create_ will slide into view from
    the right-hand side of the browser window. You will notice several
    rounded boxes on that pane, each for defining, configuring, and
    instantiating a different {{brand}} object. Go ahead and click the
    _Load Balancer_ box.

    ![Create new object](assets/shot-01.png)

    A new pane titled _Create a Load Balancer_ will slide over. At the top,
    type in a name for the new load balancer and select one of the
    available regions. Optionally, type in a description.

    ![Set name, region, and description for the new LB](assets/shot-02.png)

    In the same pane, scroll down a bit if you have to and activate the
    _Subnet_ radio button. Then, from the _Subnet_ dropdown menu below,
    select an appropriate subnet for the new load balancer to move in front
    of. In our example, the two test servers we have are members of the
    `network-fra1` internal network, and `subnet-fra1` is the name of the
    corresponding subnet. Click the green _Create_ button below to
    instantiate the new load balancer.

    ![Select a subnet for the new LB](assets/shot-03.png)

    The creation of the new load balancer starts and, unless something goes
    wrong, finishes successfully in a minute or so. For a view of the load
    balancer, make sure the left-hand side vertical pane of the {{gui}} is
    fully visible, click on the _Networking_ category to expand it, and then
    click once more on the _Load Balancers_ option. In the main area of the
    {{gui}}, select the new load balancer, click the three-dot icon on the
    right, and select _View details_ from the pop-up menu that appears.

    ![View the newly created LB](assets/shot-04.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    To create your load balancer, type something like this:

    ```bash
    openstack loadbalancer create \
        --name mylb --vip-subnet-id subnet-fra1
    ```

    ```text

    +---------------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

    In the example above, the name of the load balancer is `mylb`, and the
    subnet it will be in front of is named `subnet-fra1` (this is the
    subnet our two test servers are members of). You will notice in the
    command output that, at first, the `provisioning_status` is
    `PENDING_CREATE`. To make sure the load balancer has been successfully
    created, try this command a couple of times:

    ```bash
    openstack loadbalancer show mylb -c provisioning_status
    ```

    ```text
    +---------------------+--------+
    | Field               | Value  |
    +---------------------+--------+
    | provisioning_status | ACTIVE |
    +---------------------+--------+
    ```

## Creating a listener

A load balancer needs a way to listen for incoming client connection
requests. The _listener_ allows a load balancer to do just that. The
load balancer you instantiated has no listener, so let us see how you
can equip it with one.

=== "{{gui}}"
    Looking at the detailed view of the new load balancer, you see three
    tabs: _Details_, _Listeners_, and _Pools_. Click the _Listeners_ tab
    and notice the message: "No Listeners for this LoadBalancer". Time to
    create one, so click the green button labeled _Create a Listener_.

    ![Create a listener](assets/shot-05.png)

    From the right-hand side of the {{gui}}, a pane named _Create a
    Listener_ slides over. Type in a name for the new listener --- and
    optionally a description.

    ![Set name and description for the new listener](assets/shot-06.png)

    Further down, from the _Protocol_ dropdown menu, select the protocol
    the listener will be paying attention to. Since you are setting up a
    TCP load balancer, the protocol for the listener will also have to be
    TCP. Additionally, type in the listening port. The load balancer will
    be redirecting connections to a couple of servers, which listen for
    connections on port 61234/TCP, so it makes sense ---though it is not
    necessary--- for the load balancer to use that same listening port.
    Since you have not yet defined a pool, ignore the _Default pool_
    dropdown menu for now. Instead, go ahead and click the green _Create_
    button.

    ![Select protocol and set port](assets/shot-07.png)

    The listener will be created in no time, and you will be able to see
    its characteristics in the _Listeners_ tab of your load balancer
    detailed view.

    ![Listener successfully created](assets/shot-08.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    Create a listener for your load balancer like this:

    ```bash
    openstack loadbalancer listener create \
        --name mylb-listener --protocol TCP --protocol-port 61234 mylb
    ```

    ```text

    +-----------------------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

    To check the `provisioning_status`, type the following:

    ```bash
    openstack loadbalancer listener show mylb-listener -c provisioning_status
    ```

    ```text
    +---------------------+--------+
    | Field               | Value  |
    +---------------------+--------+
    | provisioning_status | ACTIVE |
    +---------------------+--------+
    ```

    Since you wanted to create a TCP load balancer, in the command above,
    you specified the connection protocol via the `--protocol` parameter.
    Also, the new load balancer will be redirecting connections to a couple
    of servers listening on port 61234, so it makes sense to set the
    listening port to 61234 (see the `--protocol-port` parameter).

## Creating a pool

Any server accepting connections from the listener is said to be a
_member_ of a _pool_. For our load balancer to work, we must create a
pool and explicitly list its members.

=== "{{gui}}"
    With the detailed view of the load balancer expanded, click the _Pools_
    tab. You will notice the message "No pools for this LoadBalancer", so
    click the green _Create a Pool_ button.

    ![Create a pool](assets/shot-09.png)

    A new pane named _Create a Pool_ slides over. First, type in a name for
    the new pool. For the _Algorithm_, make sure to select *ROUND_ROBIN*.
    Since you are configuring a TCP load balancer, set the _Protocol_ to
    _TCP_.

    ![Type in name, set algorithm and protocol](assets/shot-10.png)

    A little bit further down the pane, there is the _Listener_ dropdown
    menu; select the one you created in the previous step. Leave the
    _Session persistence_ parameter as it is, and create your pool with a
    click on the green _Create_ button.

    ![Select listener, create pool](assets/shot-11.png)

    The pool is instantaneously available; as you can see, it has zero
    members and one listener (the one you created in the previous step).

    ![Zero members, one listener](assets/shot-12.png)

    Notice that the listener already knows about the new pool, even though
    you did not explicitly mention it.

    ![The listener knows](assets/shot-13.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    To create a pool named `mylb-pool` that distributes incoming TCP
    connections to its members in a round-robin fashion from the listener
    named `mylb-listener`, type this command:

    ```bash
    openstack loadbalancer pool create \
        --name mylb-pool --lb-algorithm ROUND_ROBIN \
        --listener mylb-listener --protocol TCP
    ```

    ```text

    +----------------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

    Once more, you may check the `provisioning_status` by typing the
    following:

    ```bash
    openstack loadbalancer pool show mylb-pool -c provisioning_status
    ```

    ```text
    +---------------------+--------+
    | Field               | Value  |
    +---------------------+--------+
    | provisioning_status | ACTIVE |
    +---------------------+--------+
    ```

## Adding members to the pool

The pool you created has no members, so it is time to populate it.

=== "{{gui}}"
    In the detailed view of your load balancer, go to the _Pools_ tab and
    click the bulleted-list icon.

    ![Populate the pool](assets/shot-14.png)

    A new pane titled _Modify Pool Members_ appears, listing all the
    servers that share the same region with the load balancer. In our
    example, there are three servers. We created `srv-lbaas-1` and
    `srv-lbaas-2` to test the load balancer, so now we click on the
    corresponding plus-sign icons to add those to the pool.

    ![Add members](assets/shot-15.png)

    You may have noticed that the listening port of each server we added is
    by default 80, but we want port 61234. To change the listening port of
    a server, just click the corresponding notepad-and-pen icon.

    ![Modify ports](assets/shot-16.png)

    To confirm the changes, click the green _Update_ button.

    ![Apply changes to pool](assets/shot-17.png)

    At this point, the load balancer should have its listener plus a pool
    with two members.

    ![Pool is populated](assets/shot-18.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    Both our test servers are in the `subnet-fra1` subnet, one of them has
    IP `10.15.25.105`, and the other one has IP `10.15.25.236`. To add
    those two servers in pool `mylb-pool`, type:

    ```bash
    openstack loadbalancer member create \
        --subnet-id subnet-fra1 --address 10.15.25.105 \
        --protocol-port 61234 mylb-pool
    ```

    ```text
    +---------------------+--------------------------------------+
    | Field               | Value                                |

## Assigning a floating IP

Your load balancer has an internal IP chosen from the subnet you
indicated earlier. This makes it reachable from other servers in the
same subnet but not from the Internet. You probably want the load
balancer to be reachable from anywhere, meaning you have to equip it
with a floating IP.

=== "{{gui}}"
    While viewing your load balancer, click the three-dot icon on the
    right. From the pop-up menu that appears, select _Modify Load Balancer_.

    ![Modify load balancer](assets/shot-19.png)

    The _Modify Load Balancer_ pane appears. For the _Floating IP_ option,
    select _Create and attach IP_.

    ![Create and attach floating IP](assets/shot-20.png)

    A new pane slides over, named _Create a Floating IP_. For the _Region_
    parameter, select the one the load balancer resides in. For the _Assign
    to_ parameter, make sure you choose _Load Balancer_. In our example,
    there's only one load balancer in the region we are working in, so the
    parameter _Assign To_ is already set for us. To finalize the
    assignment, click the green _Create and Assign_ button.

    ![Configure attachment](assets/shot-21.png)

    As you may see, your load balancer now has a floating IP. You can now
    use that to test the balancer and make sure it works as expected.

    ![Floating IP attached to load balancer](assets/shot-22.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    First, create a new floating IP:

    ```bash
    openstack floating ip create ext-net
    ```

    +---------------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

    Then, load the ID of the new floating IP to a variable:

    ```bash
    FLOAT_IP_ID=$(openstack floating ip list \
        --floating-ip-address 198.51.100.129 -c ID -f value)
    ```

    Do the same for the VIP port ID of your load balancer:

    ```bash
    VIP_PORT_ID=$(openstack loadbalancer show mylb \
        -c vip_port_id -f value)
    ```

    Finally, assign the floating IP to your load balancer like so:

    ```bash
    openstack floating ip set --port $VIP_PORT_ID $FLOAT_IP_ID
    ```

## Testing the load balancer

Each of the two test servers runs `ncat` to continuously listen
on port 61234/TCP and respond to clients with a simple message,
revealing its hostname:

```bash
ncat -kv -l 61234 -c 'echo Yello from $(hostname)!'
```

Since the load balancer has a floating IP (`198.51.100.129`,
in our example), and we know the port it listens to, we can
try connecting to it via `wget` and see what happens:

```bash
wget -q 198.51.100.129:61234 -O -
```

```plain
Yello from srv-lbaas-1!
```

It looks like we talked to the first test server. If we run the
exact same `wget` command for a second time, since the load balancer
distributes client connection requests in a round-robin fashion,
we expect to talk to the second server:

```bash
wget -q 198.51.100.129:61234 -O -
```

```plain
Yello from srv-lbaas-2!
```

During our testing, executing the `wget` command repeatedly, we were
getting those two hostnames one after the other --- and that was
proof our TCP load balancer was working as expected. But there is
one more expectation of any load balancer: the ability to skip
backend hosts when they are inaccessible.

To test our load balancer in this new scenario, let us first use
`wget` to connect to port 61234 and jot down the backend server
that will respond:

```bash
wget -q 198.51.100.129:61234 -O -
```

```plain
Yello from srv-lbaas-2!
```

We see that `srv-lbaas-2` responded. That means the next time we
try to connect, `srv-lbaas-1` will respond. But if we SSH into
`srv-lbaas-1` and terminate `ncat`, then after connecting with
`wget` we will get a response from `srv-lbaas-2` --- again. This,
at least, is our expectation. So without further ado, we SSH into
`srv-lbaas-1`, we terminate `ncat`, we log out, and from our local
terminal, we type:

```bash
wget -q 198.51.100.129:61234 -O -
```

```plain
Yello from srv-lbaas-2!
```

Exactly as we expected, `srv-lbaas-2` has responded again, proving
our load balancer behaves correctly. As an exercise, you might want
to shutdown your `srv-lbaas-1` and/or re-enable `ncat`, and check
the behavior of the load balancer. There should be no surprises.

## Adding a health monitor

You can add a health monitor to the pool of your load balancer,
so whenever ---and for whatever reason--- one or more of the pool
member services are inaccessible, the load balancer will know and
won't even bother trying to redirect client requests to them. Of
course, whenever an inaccessible service gets accessible again,
the load balancer will take notice and start treating the
corresponding pool member as a fully functional server.

=== "{{gui}}"
    In the detailed view of your load balancer, pull up the
    _Pools_ tab. In the _Health Monitor_ column there is a "0",
    for the pool has no health monitor yet.

    ![There is no health monitor](assets/shot-23.png)

    To add a health monitor, click the notepad-and-pen icon.
    A pane titled _Modify Pool_ slides over. Scroll down if
    you have to, and stop when the _Health Monitor_ section is
    fully visible. You will see a message saying, "No health
    monitor created", so click the green _Create a Healthmonitor_
    button to create one.

    ![Create new health monitor](assets/shot-24.png)

    Pick a name for the new health monitor, and set its type to
    TCP. That is the connection protocol that will be used to
    determine whether pool member services are accessible.
    Finalize your choices with a click on the green _Create_
    button.

    ![Define health monitor characteristics](assets/shot-25.png)

    You will then see that in the _Health Monitor_ column there
    is a "1" --- and that means the monitor is active. To see
    real-time information regarding pool members operating status,
    click over "1".

    ![Check members operating status](assets/shot-26.png)
=== "OpenStack CLI"
    To create a health monitor for pool `mylb-pool` of load
    balancer `mylb`, type something like the following:

    ```bash
    openstack loadbalancer healthmonitor create \
        --name=mylb-pool-healthmon --type=TCP \
        --delay=10 --timeout=5 --max-retries=1 \
        mylb-pool
    ```

    +---------------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

    The name of the new health monitor is `mylb-pool-healthmon`,
    and the TCP protocol will be used to check whether members
    of pool `mylb-pool` are online or offline. To check the
    provisioning status of the health monitor, type:

    ```bash
    openstack loadbalancer healthmonitor show \
        mylb-pool-healthmon -c provisioning_status
    ```

    ```plain
    +---------------------+--------+
    | Field               | Value  |
    +---------------------+--------+
    | provisioning_status | ACTIVE |
    +---------------------+--------+
    ```

    Once the health monitor is provisioned, you may at any time
    check the pool members status like so:

    ```bash
    openstack loadbalancer member list mylb-pool
    ```

## Observing and testing the monitor

Having a health monitor for your load balancer's pool up and
running, whenever the service of interest in any of the pool
members gets inaccessible, the monitor notices and immediately
considers the corresponding member as offline. From then on,
and until the same service gets accessible again, the load
balancer does not even try to redirect client connections to
the affected member. During our testing, we killed `ncat`
running on `srv-lbaas-1`, and then took a look at the health
monitor from the {{gui}} --- and also from a local terminal.

=== "{{gui}}"
    In the detailed view of your load balancer, pull up the
    _Pools_ tab and click anywhere on its line. After a second
    or two, you will see information regarding all pool members.
    Pay attention to the _Operating Status_ column, where you
    can see the status of any of the pool members.

=== "OpenStack CLI"
    To check the operating status of any of the pool members
    of your load balancer, type something like this:

    ```bash
    openstack loadbalancer member list mylb-pool
    ```

    ```plain

    | 6f8767437 |           |            |                     |           |               |                  |        |
    | 50c       |           |            |                     |           |               |                  |        |
    +-----------+-----------+------------+---------------------+-----------+---------------+------------------+--------+
    ```

    In the example above, see the `operating_status` column,
    specifically the status of server `srv-lbaas-1`. Regarding
    the operating status of all pool members, you can always
    limit the scope of your query like so:

    ```bash
    openstack loadbalancer member list mylb-pool \
        -c name -c operating_status
    ```

    ```plain
    +-------------+------------------+
    | name        | operating_status |
    +-------------+------------------+
    | srv-lbaas-1 | ERROR            |
    | srv-lbaas-2 | ONLINE           |
    +-------------+------------------+
    ```

Finally, let us see what happens when we repeatedly try to
access the remote service via the load balancer:

```console
$ wget -q 198.51.100.129:61234 -O -
Yello from srv-lbaas-2!

$ wget -q 198.51.100.129:61234 -O -
Yello from srv-lbaas-2!

$ wget -q 198.51.100.129:61234 -O -
Yello from srv-lbaas-2!
```

Since pool member `srv-lbaas-1` is offline to the health
monitor, we keep getting an answer from `srv-lbaas-2`.
Actually, while the service of interest in `srv-lbaas-1` is
inaccessible, then no matter how many times we run the command
above we will keep getting a response from `srv-lbaas-2` only.
