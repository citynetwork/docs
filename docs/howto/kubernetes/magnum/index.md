# Magnum

Magnum lets you create clusters via the OpenStack APIs.
To do that, you base your configuration on a Cluster Template.
The template defines parameters, such as worker flavors, which describe how the cluster will be constructed.
In each region, we offer predefined public Cluster Templates with ready-to-use configurations.
To learn more about Cluster Templates, check out the [Magnum documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/magnum/latest/user/#clustertemplate).

Once you have chosen your Cluster Template, you move on to [create a cluster based on that template](../../openstack/magnum/new-k8s-cluster.md).
When you create the cluster, you can define the number of nodes, ask for multiple masters behind a load balancer, etc.
