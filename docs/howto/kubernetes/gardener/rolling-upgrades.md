description: How to manually upgrade machine images or Kubernetes versions for Gardener clusters

# Conducting rolling upgrades

By default, Kubernetes clusters created with {{k8s_management_service}} in {{brand}} are upgraded automatically.
Those upgrades take place during a specified maintenance window, and you may find out more about [what they involve and how they work](../../../background/kubernetes/gardener/autoupgrades.md).
Besides the automatic upgrades, you may manually apply any upgrades available for your cluster.

In the following two examples, we first show how to manually upgrade the machine image the cluster nodes are based on.
Then, we show how to upgrade the Kubernetes version the cluster uses.

## Upgrading machine images

In the left-hand vertical pane of the {{gui}}, select Containers â†’ [{{k8s_management_service}}](https://{{gui_domain}}/containers/gardener).
In the central pane, you will see all your {{k8s_management_service}} clusters, each on its own row.
If a Kubernetes upgrade is available for a shoot cluster, in the *Version* column you will notice a blue :fontawesome-solid-circle-arrow-up: icon, together with the new Kubernetes version.
Additionally, if there is a new machine image version for the cluster nodes, then in the *Worker Groups* column you will also notice a blue :fontawesome-solid-circle-arrow-up: icon but no version number.

To get more information about the new machine image available, click on the cluster row to bring its details up into view, then select the *Worker Groups* tab.
There, you will see the version of the new machine image.
To start the upgrade process, click any of the two :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up: icons.

The upgrade process starts immediately and takes some time to complete.
A little before and after it is done, there is no icon in the *Worker Groups* column, and the new image version is displayed in the
*Image* row of the *Worker Groups* tab.
Since we have not upgraded Kubernetes yet, our example still has an icon in the *Version* column.

## Upgrading Kubernetes

To get the Kubernetes upgrade process going, click the orange :material-dots-horizontal-circle: icon on the right of the cluster row.
In the following example, we go from Kubernetes 1.26 to Kubernetes 1.27; that is the latest version supported at the time of this writing.
In the pop-up menu that appears, there is an option named *Kubernetes Patch Available*.
That one is not always there, and when it is acts as yet another indicator of an available Kubernetes upgrade.
Please select the option by clicking on it.

A new pop-up window named *Upgrade Kubernetes Version for: &lt;cluster_name&gt;* appears.
From the *Version* drop-down menu, you may select the new Kubernetes version you want your cluster to upgrade to.
When ready, click the blue *Upgrade* button to start the process.

You will realize that the upgrade doesn't start right away.
Instead, you are informed that the cluster is indeed ready for it, but there are some notes you might want to read up on before the whole process begins.
The gist of it is that any existing static kubeconfig will stop working after the upgrade to Kubernetes 1.27, and you will not be able to create a new static kubeconfig.
You will, however, be able to create [a new certificate-based kubeconfig](kubectl.md).
To get the upgrade going, click the *Upgrade* button which is now green.

After some minutes, the upgrade will be over.
The new Kubernetes version will be visible in the *Version* column of the cluster row.
