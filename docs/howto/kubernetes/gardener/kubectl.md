# Managing a Kubernetes cluster

Once you [have launched a new cluster](create-shoot-cluster.md), you can interact with it using `kubectl` with a [kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) file.

## Prerequisites

On your local computer, you should make sure you have `kubectl`, the Kubernetes command line tool.
As soon as you do, you may issue commands against your clusters.
To install `kubectl`, follow [the official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

## Extracting the kubeconfig file

You can access your shoot cluster using a **certificate-based** kubeconfig file.
Such a kubeconfig is valid for a predefined amount of time, during which it can be used for accessing the corresponding shoot cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
The credentials associated with this type of kubeconfig are client certificates with time-limited validity.

To get a kubeconfig file for a shoot cluster, in the {{gui}} click on the cluster row to bring its properties into full view and go to the *KubeConfig* tab.

Notice that you may set the duration of the kubeconfig file validity.

![KubeConfig tab in {{k8s_management_service}} Shoot view](assets/shoot_kubeconfig_cert_01.png)

The default validity period is one hour, but you may use the drop-down menu to select a different duration.

![Select a validity period for kubeconfig](assets/shoot_kubeconfig_cert_02.png)

When satisfied with the duration, click the green button labeled *Generate config*.

![Generate a certificate-based kubeconfig](assets/shoot_kubeconfig_cert_03.png)

Right below, you will see the contents of your dynamically generated kubeconfig.
To get the file, click the blue button labeled *Download KubeConfig*.

![Download the newly generated kubeconfig](assets/shoot_kubeconfig_cert_04.png)

In the default download folder of your local user account, you will get a configuration file named like so:

```plain
kubeconfig--<cluster_name>--<region_name>--<project_id>.yaml
```

Create a directory named `.kube` in your local user's home, then move the YAML file you downloaded into it.
Rename the YAML to `config`, ending up with `~/.kube/config`.
By default, `kubectl` searches for its configuration in `~/.kube/config`.
If necessary, you can [modify this behavior](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) by setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable.
For example, if you want to retain the original filename exactly as downloaded, you might type something like the following:

```shell
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/kubeconfig--<cluster_name>--<region_name>--<project_id>.yaml
```

If you manage multiple Kubernetes clusters, you will probably prefer this approach.

## Verifying your kubeconfig

Check if your `kubectl` uses the proper configuration by running:

```shell
kubectl config view
```

You should see something like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: DATA+OMITTED
    server: https://api.myshoot.pqrxyz.k8s.cleura.cloud
  name: garden-pqrxyz--myshoot-external
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: DATA+OMITTED
    server: https://api.myshoot.pqrxyz.internal.k8s.cleura.cloud
  name: garden-pqrxyz--myshoot-internal
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: garden-pqrxyz--myshoot-external
    user: garden-pqrxyz--myshoot-external
  name: garden-pqrxyz--myshoot-external
- context:
    cluster: garden-pqrxyz--myshoot-internal
    user: garden-pqrxyz--myshoot-external
  name: garden-pqrxyz--myshoot-internal
current-context: garden-pqrxyz--myshoot-external
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: garden-pqrxyz--myshoot-external
  user:
    client-certificate-data: DATA+OMITTED
    client-key-data: DATA+OMITTED
```

Keep in mind that the cluster API endpoints (the `server` entries in your kubeconfig) are dynamically managed DNS addresses.
{{brand_container_orchestration}} automatically created the DNS records upon shoot cluster creation.

The DNS records will subsequently disappear when you delete the cluster.
They *also* disappear when you [hibernate the shoot cluster](hibernate-shoot-cluster.md), and reappear when you wake it from hibernation.

## Accessing your cluster with `kubectl`

Check your available nodes by running:

```shell
kubectl get nodes
```

Assuming you used the default options when creating the cluster, you should now see the three {{k8s_management_service}} worker nodes that are initially available:

```console
NAME                                           STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
shoot--pqrxyz--myshoot-cwncz1-z1-7656c-cx8zn   Ready    <none>   23h   v1.30.5
shoot--pqrxyz--myshoot-cwncz1-z1-7656c-nvgmc   Ready    <none>   23h   v1.30.5
shoot--pqrxyz--myshoot-cwncz1-z1-7656c-rrkmz   Ready    <none>   23h   v1.30.5
```

> Please note that in contrast to an [OpenStack Magnum-managed Kubernetes cluster](../../openstack/magnum/new-k8s-cluster.md), where the output of `kubectl get nodes` includes control plane *and* worker nodes, in a {{k8s_management_service}} cluster the same command *only* lists the worker nodes.

## Deploying an application

Create a sample deployment with a Hello World application:

```console
$ kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=registry.k8s.io/echoserver:1.4
deployment.apps/hello-node created

$ kubectl expose deployment hello-node --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
service/hello-node exposed
```

To access the created app, list the available services:

```shell
kubectl get services
```

After a minute or so, you should get the load balancer service *with* its external IP and port number:

```console
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)          AGE
hello-node   LoadBalancer   100.70.213.140   198.51.100.42  8080:32421/TCP   2m50s
kubernetes   ClusterIP      100.64.0.1       <none>         443/TCP          23h
```

Open a browser and navigate to `http://198.51.100.42:8080` (substituting the correct `EXTERNAL-IP` listed for your service).
You should see the page of the Hello World app.

## Rotating kubeconfig

You may rotate an existing kubeconfig for a fresh one.
Since certificate-based kubeconfig files have time-bound validity, issuing fresh kubeconfig files of this type is standard practice.

In addition to creating new certificate-based kubeconfig files, it is highly recommended to rotate the CA bundle used for creating them in the first place.
Here's how to go about it, using the {{gui}}.

Locate the shoot cluster you are interested in.
Click on its row to bring all relevant details into view, and go to the *KubeConfig* tab.
Click the red button labeled *Rotate CA Bundle*.

![Click the red button labeled "Rotate CA Bundle"](assets/kubeconfig_cert_rotate_01.png)

A new window pops up, informing you in detail about the 3-step process that is about to take place.
Please notice that it may take up to twenty minutes to complete.
When ready, click the red *Start CA rotation* button.

![Detailed information regarding the whole CA bundle rotation process](assets/kubeconfig_cert_rotate_02.png)

During the first step, a new CA bundle is generated.
This may take up to ten minutes to complete.
During that time, the existing kubeconfig file still works.

![Generating a new CA bundle](assets/kubeconfig_cert_rotate_03.png)

When the new CA bundle is ready, you remove the existing one by clicking the red *Remove old CA bundle* button.
As soon as you click it, the existing kubeconfig stops working.

![Removing the old CA bundle](assets/kubeconfig_cert_rotate_04.png)

The old CA bundle removal process may take up to ten minutes.
Notice the gray animated icon, indicating the process is ongoing.

![Old CA bundle removal in progress](assets/kubeconfig_cert_rotate_05.png)

It is now time to create a new certificate-based kubeconfig, which will be based on the new CA bundle.
This time, click the *Back* button, or the CA bundle creation process will start over.

![Time to create a fresh certificate-based kubeconfig file](assets/kubeconfig_cert_rotate_06.png)

Choose a duration for the new kubeconfig, then click the green *Generate config* button.

![Set duration for the new kubeconfig and generate it](assets/kubeconfig_cert_rotate_07.png)

To get your new certificate-based kubeconfig file, click the blue *Download KubeConfig* button.
