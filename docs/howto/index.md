# About our How-To guides

In this section you’ll find details about how you can accomplish
specific tasks in {{config.extra.brand}} and the services we support.

There are several categories of How-To guides, and they tend to be
focused on a specific cloud technology.

* **Getting Started** How-Tos help you create an account in Cleura
  Cloud, and start using our services.

* **Kubernetes** How-Tos cover how you can create and manage your
  Kubernetes deployments using {{config.extra.gui}}.

* **Object storage** How-Tos deal with the S3 and Swift object storage
  APIs, and how you can use them for object storage in
  {{config.extra.brand}}.

* **OpenStack CLI/API** How-Tos cover tasks that you can accomplish
  with the OpenStack command line interfaces and application
  programming interfaces. They generally do not depend on any adjacent
  services or tools, just your {{config.extra.brand}} OpenStack
  credentials, the `openstack` client, and/or the native OpenStack
  APIs.

<!-- TODO: we’ll enable these as we migrate content.
* **Terraform** How-Tos deal with Terraform configurations and how you
  can apply them in {{config.extra.brand}}. They build on the
  `terraform` binary and the
  [OpenStack](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/terraform-provider-openstack/openstack/latest/docs)
  and
  [Kubernetes](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs)
  providers.
