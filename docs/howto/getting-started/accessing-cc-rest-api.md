# Accessing the Cleura Cloud REST API

{{brand}} provides a REST API, which you can take advantage of with a tool like `curl`.
But before you do, you must create a token for the current session.
For that, you only need to have an [account in {{brand}}](create-account.md).

## Creating a token

{{rest_api}} calls use token authentication.
The process of obtaining a valid token works slightly differently, based on whether your account has two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled or not.

=== "Without 2FA"
    If you do not have 2FA enabled for your account, to create a token, have your username (`your_cc_username`) and password (`your_cc_password`) to the {{brand}} handy and type:

    ```bash
    curl -d '{"auth": {"login": "your_cc_username", "password": "your_cc_password"}}' \
        https://{{rest_api_domain}}/auth/v1/tokens
    ```

    Provided you typed your username and password correctly and that there were no connection issues to the remote endpoint, you will get a JSON object with a string (`token`) that holds your session token:

    ```json
    {
      "result": "login_ok",
      "token": "vahkie7EiDaij7chegaitee2zohsh1oh"
    }
    ```

=== "With 2FA"

    If your {{brand}} account has 2FA enabled, you **must** configure it with SMS as a second-factor option.
    Accounts with only WebAuthn as their second factor cannot be used for {{rest_api}} operations.

    First, initiate a token request giving your {{brand}} username and password, and setting the `twofa_method` option to `sms`:

    ```bash
    curl -d '{"auth": {"login": "your_cc_username", "password": "your_cc_password", "twofa_method": "sms"}}' \
        https://{{rest_api_domain}}/auth/v1/tokens
    ```

    Instead of a token, you will get a verification code (look at `verification`):

    ```json
    {
      "result": "twofactor_required",
      "type": "sms",
      "verification": "ahb4en3cho"
    }
    ```

    This verification code is required for requesting a 2FA code:

    ```bash
    curl -d '{"request2fa": {"login": "your_cc_username", "verification": "ahb4en3cho"}}' \
        https://{{rest_api_domain}}/auth/v1/tokens/request2facode
    ```

    You will now receive your 6-digit second-factor code via an SMS message.
    This enables you to request your REST API token like this:

    ```bash
    curl -d '{"verify2fa": {"login": "your_cc_username", "verification": "ahb4en3cho", "code": 123456}}' \
        https://{{rest_api_domain}}/auth/v1/tokens/verify2fa
    ```

    Make sure *not* to put the code in quotes, for it is of type integer and that fact should be reflected during the assignment to `code`.
    You will get a JSON object with your token:

    ```json
    {
      "result": "login_ok",
      "token": "fiushood9oraTiNa4ban3eemeezoeDae"
    }
    ```

Now that you have obtained a valid token, you can proceed with making {{rest_api}} calls.

## Testing the token

One way to make sure the token is valid is by getting a list of all supported regions.
All you have to do is use `curl` to provide your username (`your_cc_username`) and token and connect to the `https://{{rest_api_domain}}/accesscontrol/v1/openstack/domains` endpoint:

```bash
curl -H "X-AUTH-LOGIN: your_cc_username" \
    -H "X-AUTH-TOKEN: vahkie7EiDaij7chegaitee2zohsh1oh" \
    https://{{rest_api_domain}}/accesscontrol/v1/openstack/domains
```

All supported regions should be returned as objects in a JSON array:

```json
[
  {
    "area": {
      "id": "6",
      "name": "Sweden \/ Stockholm",
      "tag": "SE_STO2",
      "regions": [
        {
          "zone_id": "2",
          "name": "Stockholm \/ Sweden",
          "status": "active",
          "region": "Sto2"
        }
      ]
    },
    "id": "b7c3998142f0496aa3582d8a3ae9ae1e",
    "status": "provisioned",
    "name": "CCP_Domain_123P456",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "area": {
      "id": "7",
      "name": "Germany \/ Frankfurt",
      "tag": "DE",
      "regions": [
        {
          "zone_id": "6",
          "name": "Frankfurt \/ Germany",
          "status": "active",
          "region": "Fra1"
        }
      ]
    },
    "id": "2d04a791db0e4a799b65c3794eda09bf",
    "status": "provisioned",
    "name": "CCP_Domain_123P456",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "area": {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "Europe",
      "tag": "EU",
      "regions": [
        {
          "zone_id": "1",
          "name": "Karlskrona \/ Sweden",
          "status": "active",
          "region": "Kna1"
        }
      ]
    },
    "id": "989d137c832c42eb9a6c6839a5c28675",
    "status": "provisioned",
    "name": "CCP_Domain_123P456",
    "enabled": true
  }
]
```
