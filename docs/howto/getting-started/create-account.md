# Creating a new account

For access to {{brand}}, you first have to create a new account.
For that, navigate to <https://{{gui_domain}}/register>.

![Type in necessary details](assets/02-type-email-country.png)

Select the new account type (*Company* or *Private*), type in a valid email address, and choose your country.
Please be sure to read the {{ legal_docs.tos.name}} and our {{ legal_docs.cdpa.name}}.

Agree to these documents (select *Yes*), check the *I'm not a robot* box, and then click on the *Create* button.

This will redirect you to the {{gui}}, and since you are logging in from a new account for the first time, you now have to take three steps.

![Three steps to take](assets/03-step-1.png)

* **Step 1 - Confirm your email**.
  Check your inbox or your spam/junk folder for an email from `no-reply@cleura.com` with the subject *Thank you for your registration - Cleura Cloud*.
  Open that email, and click on the link in the message body.

* **Step 2 - Account information**.
  After clicking on the confirmation link you move on to step two, where you enter the information that uniquely identifies the brand-new account.
  Type in a username for the account user, and define a strong password.
  (We recommend using a password manager.)
  Please note that all fields are mandatory.
  In case you have a voucher code, click on *I have a voucher code* and type it in below.
  When you are done, click on the *Save* button.

* **Step 3 - Account verification**.
  To make your account fully operational, you have to take one more verification step.
  You do that either by entering valid credit card information, or by placing a phone call.
  Verifying by credit card does *not* incur charges.
  If you prefer to verify by phone (available only for *Company* accounts), you may do so during business hours (08:00 â€“ 17:00 CET/CEST UTC+1/UTC+2).
  During the verification call, you will be asked for the username of the new account.

After the account verification is complete, you can start using [{{gui}}](https://{{gui_domain}}).
