# Object Storage

{{brand}} gives you the option of storing your data in RESTful object storage.

If your application allows it, using object storage is often a cost-effective alternative to storing your data in virtual [block devices](../openstack/cinder/index.md) attached to [virtual machines](../openstack/nova/index.md).

You can use two different APIs to interact with object storage in {{brand}}: the [S3 API](s3/index.md), and the [OpenStack Swift API](swift/index.md).
