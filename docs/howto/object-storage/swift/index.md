# Swift API

[OpenStack Swift](https://docs.openstack.org/swift/) (not to be
confused with [the programming language of the same
name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language))) is
an object-access API similar to, but distinct from, the [S3](../s3/index.md) object
storage API.

In {{brand}}, you interact with the Swift API using either the `swift`
command-line interface (CLI), or the standard `openstack` CLI.

Either way, [in addition to installing and configuring the Python
`openstackclient`
module](../../getting-started/enable-openstack-cli.md), you need to
install the Python `swiftclient` module. Use either the package
manager of your operating system, or `pip`:

=== "Debian/Ubuntu"
    ```bash
    apt install python3-swiftclient
    ```
=== "Mac OS X with Homebrew"
    This Python module is unavailable via `brew`, but you can
    install it via `pip`.
=== "Python Package"
    ```bash
    pip install python-swiftclient
    ```

## Availability

The OpenStack Swift API is available in select {{brand}}
regions. Refer to [the feature support matrix](../../../reference/features/index.md)
for details on Swift API availability.
