# Object versioning

Using the Swift API, you have the option to retain multiple versions
of an object, rather than overwriting it in place.

## Prerequisites

In order to manage object versioning, be sure that you have [installed
and configured](index.md) the `swift` command-line interface (CLI). There
is presently no way to set object expiry with the `openstack` CLI.

Also, ensure that you have configured a [private
container](private-container.md), i.e. one with an empty Read ACL. The
examples in this how-to guide assume that your container is named
`private-container`, and that it presently contains a single object
named `testobj.txt`.

## Creating a container for non-current versioned objects

In addition to the container holding your live objects,
`private-container`, you will also need one for your prior
versions. In this example, we use the name
`private-container-versions` for that container:

```bash
swift post private-container-versions
```
This command produces no output.

## Setting `X-Versions-Location`

You must next set the `X-Versions-Location` header on the *original*
container:

```bash
swift post -H "X-Versions-Location: private-container-versions" private-container
```

## Testing object versioning

You can now verify that object versioning is working correctly.

1. Upload a new version of `testobj.txt`:
   ```console
   $ echo "bye bye" > testobj.txt
   $ swift upload private-container testobj.txt

   ```
2. Observe that there is now a newly created object in the
   `private-container-versions` container:
   ```console
   $ swift list private-container-versions
   00btestobj.txt/1670250073.717985
   ```
3. Issue a command to delete the object:
   ```console
   $ swift delete private-container testobj.txt
   testobj.txt
   ```
4. Read back the object. Since the container is now versioned, the
   "deletion" in step 3 only caused a roll-back to the object's prior
   state:
   ```console
   $ swift download -o - private-container testobj.txt
   hello world
   ```

> Object versioning does not prevent deleting the *last remaining*
> (i.e. first created) version of an object. Do not use object
> versioning as a prevention mechanism for inadvertent object
> deletion; it is not suitable for that purpose.
