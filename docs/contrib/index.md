## Technical Writing Resources

Whether you are an experienced technical writer, a regular (or
not-so-regular) open source contributor, or you‚Äôre making your very
first writing contribution, there are a ton of helpful resources on
technical writing. Here are a few:

* [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)‚Äôs [Technical Writing
  Guidelines](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/digitalocean-s-technical-writing-guidelines)
* [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com)‚Äôs [Writing Style
  Guide](https://github.com/StyleGuides/WritingStyleGuide)

## Markdown

The documentation on this site uses
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Markdown is a
documentation format that is rich enough to be useful for good
technical documentation, and yet simpler and easier to learn than
other formats like
[reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) or
[DocBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook) XML.

If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with Markdown, you can read up on its basics in
[this classic article by John
Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) if you‚Äôre
interested, but chances are that you‚Äôll also find all the information
you‚Äôll need in [this cheat sheet by Adam
Pritchard](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet),
or the [Start Writing guide from
GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

Or you simply look at the source of one of the pages on this site (try
the Edit button on this one!) and figure it out as you go along ‚Äî it‚Äôs
really pretty straightforward.

## Modifications to content on this site

You have two options for editing content: directly in your browser
using GitHub, or using a Git-based workflow from your local work
environment.


### Making contributions from your browser

Every page on this site has an Edit button üñçÔ∏è. If you click it, it‚Äôll
take you straight to the corresponding source page in GitHub. Then,
you can follow [GitHub‚Äôs
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-another-users-repository)
on how to propose changes to another user‚Äôs repository.


### Making contributions using Git

The Git repository for this site lives at <{{ config.repo_url }}>. You
can [fork that
repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo),
make the proposed changes in your fork, and then send us a standard
[GitHub pull
request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

For this purpose, use `git` in combination with either GitHub's web
interface, or the `gh` command-line interface (CLI).

First, create a fork of the documentation repository:

=== "`git` client and web browser"
    Open <{{ config.repo_url }}> and click the *Fork* button.
    When you create your new fork, it's fine to leave the
    *Copy the `main` branch only* option enabled.
    
    Then, proceed to create a new local checkout of your fork:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:<yourusername>/<your-repo-fork> {{ config.extra.brand | lower }}-docs
    cd {{ config.extra.brand | lower }}-docs
    ```
=== "`gh` client"
    ```bash
    gh repo fork --clone {{ config.repo_url }} -- {{ config.extra.brand | lower }}-docs
    cd {{ config.extra.brand | lower }}-docs
    ```
    
Next, create a local topic branch and make your modifications:
    
```bash
git checkout -b <your-topic-branch-name>
# edit your files
git add <files-to-add>
git commit
```

Please see notes on commit messages, [below](#quality-checks).

Finally, create a pull request (PR) from your changes:

=== "`git` client and web browser"
    Run the following `git` command (assuming `origin` is the
    remote that points to your fork):
    ```bash
    git push origin <your-topic-branch-name>
    ```
    Then, open your browser to the URL suggested by the `git push`
    command, and proceed to create a pull request.
=== "`gh` client"
    ```bash
    gh pr create --fill
    ```

### Monitoring changes as you edit

If you would like to see your changes as you are working on them, you
can do that with [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/). Having created a
topic branch with your modifications, run:

```bash
cd {{ config.extra.brand | lower }}-docs
git checkout <your-topic-branch-name>
tox -e serve
```

A local copy of the documentation will then run on your local machine
and be accessible from <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.


## Quality checks

There are a few checks that we apply to the configuration. They run
automatically via GitHub Actions workflows when you send your PR:

* We check the commit message with
  [gitlint](https://jorisroovers.com/gitlint/), and enforce the
  [Conventional
  Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) commit
  message style.
* We check whether the documentation still builds correctly, with your
  change applied.
* We check to make sure that no internal or external links in the
  documentation are dead. This is one example where the checks might
  fail through no fault of yours at all ‚Äî some external link may have
  disappeared between the most recent change and your contribution, by
  pure coincidence. When that happens, we‚Äôll fix it together.
* We check some YAML conventions with
  [yamllint](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). However,
  most contributions would probably only touch Markdown files and not
  YAML, so you‚Äôre unlikely to trip over this.

If you‚Äôre working in your local Git repository and your work
environment has [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/) installed, you can
also run the checks locally:

```bash
tox
```

You can also configure your local checkout to run quality checks on
each commit. To do that, run:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```
