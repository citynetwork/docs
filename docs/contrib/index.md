## Technical Writing Resources

Whether you are an experienced technical writer, a regular (or
not-so-regular) open source contributor, or you’re making your very
first writing contribution, there are a ton of helpful resources on
technical writing. Here are a few:

* [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)’s [Technical Writing
  Guidelines](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/digitalocean-s-technical-writing-guidelines)
* [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com)’s [Writing Style
  Guide](https://github.com/StyleGuides/WritingStyleGuide)
* [Gareth Dwyer](https://dwyer.co.za/)’s [Technical
  Writing](https://github.com/sixhobbits/technical-writing) repository
* Bolaji Ayodeji’s [Awesome Technical Writing](https://github.com/BolajiAyodeji/awesome-technical-writing) collection


## Markdown

The documentation on this site uses
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Markdown is a
documentation format that is rich enough to be useful for good
technical documentation, and yet simpler and easier to learn than
other formats like
[reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) or
[DocBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook) XML.

If you’re unfamiliar with Markdown, you can read up on its basics in
[this classic article by John
Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) if you’re
interested, but chances are that you’ll also find all the information
you’ll need in [this cheat sheet by Adam
Pritchard](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet),
or the [Start Writing guide from
GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

Or you simply look at the source of one of the pages on this site (try
the Edit button on this one!) and figure it out as you go along — it’s
really pretty straightforward.
