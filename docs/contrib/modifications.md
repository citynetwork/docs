# Modifying content on this site

You have two options for editing content: directly in your browser
using GitHub, or using a Git-based workflow from your local work
environment.


## Modifying content from your browser

Every page on this site has an Edit button üñçÔ∏è. If you click it, it‚Äôll
take you straight to the corresponding source page in GitHub. Then,
you can follow [GitHub‚Äôs
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-another-users-repository)
on how to propose changes to another user‚Äôs repository.


## Modifying content using Git

The Git repository for this site lives at <{{ config.repo_url }}>. You
can [fork that
repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo),
make the proposed changes in your fork, and then send us a standard
[GitHub pull
request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

For this purpose, use `git` in combination with either GitHub's web
interface, or the `gh` command-line interface (CLI).

First, create a fork of the documentation repository:

=== "`git` client and web browser"
    Open <{{ config.repo_url }}> and click the *Fork* button.
    When you create your new fork, it's fine to leave the
    *Copy the `main` branch only* option enabled.
    
    Then, proceed to create a new local checkout of your fork:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:<yourusername>/<your-repo-fork> {{ config.extra.brand | lower }}-docs
    cd {{ config.extra.brand | lower }}-docs
    ```
=== "`gh` client"
    ```bash
    gh repo fork --clone {{ config.repo_url }} -- {{ config.extra.brand | lower }}-docs
    cd {{ config.extra.brand | lower }}-docs
    ```
    
Next, create a local topic branch and make your modifications:
    
```bash
git checkout -b <your-topic-branch-name>
# edit your files
git add <files-to-add>
git commit
```

Please see our [notes on commit messages](../quality).

Finally, create a pull request (PR) from your changes:

=== "`git` client and web browser"
    Run the following `git` command (assuming `origin` is the
    remote that points to your fork):
    ```bash
    git push origin <your-topic-branch-name>
    ```
    Then, open your browser to the URL suggested by the `git push`
    command, and proceed to create a pull request.
=== "`gh` client"
    ```bash
    gh pr create --fill
    ```

## Monitoring changes as you edit

To see your changes as you work on them, you can use
[tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/). Having created a topic branch with
your modifications, run:

```bash
cd {{ config.extra.brand | lower }}-docs
git checkout <your-topic-branch-name>
tox -e serve
```

A local copy of the documentation will then run on your local machine
and be accessible from <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.
