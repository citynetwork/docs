# Why you should not attempt to delete projects

You may have noticed that the {{gui}} does not provide a mechanism for completely wiping out projects, also known as *tenants*.
In other words, you cannot simply delete a project and **all** of its resources in one go.
Also, you cannot delete a project even after you have meticulously deleted all of its resources.

Following is a list of facts explaining our policy **against** wiping out or deleting projects.

## Purging a project's resources is not possible

There is simply no support for deleting all resources belonging to a project in one fell swoop, not even at the OpenStack API level.
That is why you can also **not** wipe out projects even from the command line.

## A way of deleting a project

Once all of its associated resources have been removed, deleting a project is *technically* feasible.
To delete a project with no associated resources, a user with domain admin privileges may utilize the OpenStack CLI.
The `openstack` client understands the command `project`, and that command understands the `delete` subcommand.
But to successfully run `openstack project delete <project>`, domain admin privileges are required, and those are **not** available for {{brand}} users.

## Disabling a project is possible

If you wish to disable a project, you can do so via the {{rest_api}}.
Make sure [you have access](../howto/getting-started/accessing-cc-rest-api.md) to it, and then consult the documentation to actually [disable a project](https://apidoc.cleura.cloud/#api-AccessControl_Openstack-OSEditOpenstackProject).
