# {{brand}} Marketplace

{{page.meta.description}}
It is accessible via a menu option in the {{gui}}, or directly at [{{gui_domain}}/marketplace](https://{{gui_domain}}/marketplace).

You may choose any Marketplace application for quick and easy deployment in {{brand}}'s infrastructure.

Before deploying a Marketplace application, you can check the minimum resource requirements.
Please keep in mind that you always get a cost estimate in advance.
The cost depends on the specific resource selections (e.g., number of CPUs, amount of RAM) and on the type of license that covers the application under consideration.

To deploy or remove any Marketplace application, refer to the [step-by-step guides](../howto/marketplace/index.md).

## Open source and proprietary software

The {{brand}} Marketplace includes open source and proprietary applications.

There are cases of open source applications that also have proprietary editions with additional features.
There are also open source applications available with a service contract, which may include, for instance, support.

## Quality control

All applications are periodically reviewed for relevance, quality, and compliance with {{brand}} Marketplace standards.

{{brand}} does not guarantee that the {{brand}} Marketplace will contain the latest versions of available applications.
However, there may be multiple versions of a specific application to choose from.

Please keep in mind that Marketplace applications you have already deployed are not automatically updated by {{brand}}.
Instead, you have the option to maintain and keep them up-to-date.

## Support

{{brand}} will address any queries related to the {{brand}} Marketplace service itself, including service-related concerns and content issues in the service catalog.

You may submit a support ticket anytime via our [{{support}}](https://{{support_domain}}/servicedesk).

For support issues related to any application in the {{brand}} Marketplace, you should follow any guidelines offered by the developer of that particular application.
