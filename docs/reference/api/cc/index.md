# Cleura Cloud REST API reference documentation

You may at any time make good use of the {{rest_api}} with a
tool like `curl`. Regarding documentation, there is a detailed,
[automatically generated page](https://apidoc.cleura.cloud),
which you turn to for advice on endpoints and how to use them.

> To access the API, you need to have an
[account in {{brand}}](../../../howto/getting-started/create-account.md),
and also create
[a valid access token](../../../howto/getting-started/accessing-cc-rest-api.md).

All actions exposed via the {{gui}} are also available through the
{{rest_api}}. One of the most common use cases is taking advantage
of it for programmatically pulling all sorts of information for
further processing. For instance, see how you can
[retrieve invoice data](../../../howto/account-billing/rest-invoice-data.md)
via the API. For any other use of the {{rest_api}}, please see
the sections in the
[documentation page](https://apidoc.cleura.cloud).
