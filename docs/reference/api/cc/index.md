# Cleura Cloud REST API reference documentation

You may at any time make good use of the {{rest_api}} with a tool like `curl`.
Regarding documentation, there is a detailed, [automatically generated page](https://apidoc.cleura.cloud), which you turn to for advice on endpoints and how to use them.

> To access the API, you need to have an [account in {{brand}}](../../../howto/getting-started/create-account.md), and also create [a valid access token](../../../howto/getting-started/accessing-cc-rest-api.md).

All actions exposed via the {{gui}} are also available through the {{rest_api}}.
One of the most common use cases is taking advantage of it for programmatically pulling all sorts of information for further processing.
For instance, see how you can [retrieve invoice data](../../../howto/account-billing/rest-invoice-data.md) via the API.
For any other use of the {{rest_api}}, please see the sections in the [documentation page](https://apidoc.cleura.cloud).
