# Flavors

Any server instance running in {{brand}} has a **flavor**,
which defines the number of virtual CPU cores, the amount of virtual
RAM, and other performance-related factors.

{{page.meta.description}}

## Naming convention

Flavor names in {{brand}} follow a convention, which can be
summarized as `X.YcZgb`:

* `X` stands for a lowercase letter identifying the [compute
  tier](#compute-tiers), with `b` representing the general-purpose
  tier. It is always followed by a full-stop (`.`).
* `Y` stands for the number of virtual CPU cores. This number is
  always followed by the letter `c`.
* `Z` stands for the allocated amount of virtual RAM, in
  [gibibytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte#Base_2_(binary)). This
  number is always followed by the string `gb`.

For example, the flavor named `b.4c32gb` would be used for a
general-purpose compute instance with 4 cores and 32 GiB RAM.


## Compute tiers

{{brand}} defines the following compute tiers:

* `b`: General purpose. This is the default compute tier. Instances
  launched with matching flavors use highly available network-attached
  storage. This makes them flexible to migrate within the
  {{brand}} infrastructure, without interruption.
  Some
  [limitations](../../howto/openstack/cinder/encrypted-volumes.md#block-device-encryption-caveats)
  apply to instances with attached [encrypted
  volumes](../../howto/openstack/cinder/encrypted-volumes.md).
* `s`: High-performance local storage. Instances
  launched with matching flavors use local, directly-attached
  storage. This generally provides higher throughput and lower
  latency for I/O intensive applications, but instances launched with
  these flavors must configure their own high availability and data
  replication.
* `c`: Physical CPUs. Instances launched with matching flavors will be
  assigned physical CPU cores, rather then virtual ones. These flavors
  are recommended for CPU-intensive workloads, or when there is a
  requirement for guaranteed CPU resources.

Some tiers are only available in select {{brand}}
regions. For details on tier availability, see the [Feature support
matrix](../features/index.md).

The general-purpose tier is always available to all {{brand}}
customers. For access to other tiers, contact our
[{{support}}](https://{{support_domain}}/servicedesk).
