# Contribution Guide

!!! question

    See something on this site that is inaccurate, missing, or that could
	simply be improved? There are multiple ways for you to help make this
	site better, and we welcome all of them.


## Markdown

The documentation on this site uses
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Markdown is a
documentation format that is rich enough to be useful for good
technical documentation, and yet simpler and easier to learn than
other formats like
[reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) or
[DocBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook) XML.

If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with Markdown, you can read up on its basics in
[this classic article by John
Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) if you‚Äôre
interested, but chances are that you‚Äôll also find all the information
you‚Äôll need in [this cheat sheet by Adam
Pritchard](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet),
or the [Start Writing guide from
GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

Or you simply look at the source of one of the pages on this site (try
the Edit button on this one!) and figure it out as you go along ‚Äî it‚Äôs
really pretty straightforward.

## Modifications to content on this site

You have two options for editing content: directly in your browser
using GitHub, or using a Git-based workflow from your local work
environment.


### Making contributions from your browser

Every page on this site has an Edit button üñçÔ∏è. If you click it, it‚Äôll
take you straight to the corresponding source page in GitHub. Then,
you can follow [GitHub‚Äôs
documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-another-users-repository)
on how to propose changes to another user‚Äôs repository.


### Making contributions using Git

The Git repository for this site lives at <{{ config.repo_url }}>. You
can fork that repository, make the proposed changes in your fork, and
then send us a standard [GitHub pull
request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

If you would like to see your changes as you are working on them, you
can do that with [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/):

```bash
tox -e serve
```

A local copy of the documentation will then run on your local machine
and be accessible from <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.


## Quality checks

<!-- GitHub Actions workflows cannot run until the repo is made public. -->

There are a few checks that we apply to the configuration. They run
automatically via GitHub Actions workflows when you send your PR:

* We check the commit message with
  [gitlint](https://jorisroovers.com/gitlint/), and enforce the
  [Conventional
  Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) commit
  message style.
* We check whether the documentation still builds correctly, with your
  change applied.
* We check to make sure that no internal or external links in the
  documentation are dead. This is one example where the checks might
  fail through no fault of yours at all ‚Äî some external link may have
  disappeared between the most recent change and your contribution, by
  pure coincidence. When that happens, we‚Äôll fix it together.
* We check some YAML conventions with
  [yamllint](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). However,
  most contributions would probably only touch Markdown files and not
  YAML, so you‚Äôre unlikely to trip over this.

If you‚Äôre working in your local Git repository and your work
environment has [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/) installed, you can
also run the checks locally:

```bash
tox
```

You can also configure your local checkout to run quality checks on
each commit. To do that, run:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```
