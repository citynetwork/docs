Markdown is a documentation format that is rich enough to be useful for good technical documentation, and yet simpler and easier to learn than other formats like reStructuredText or DocBook XML. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with Markdown, you can read up on its basics in this classic article by John Gruber if you\u2019re interested, but chances are that you\u2019ll also find all the information you\u2019ll need in this cheat sheet by Adam Pritchard , or the Start Writing guide from GitHub . Or you simply look at the source of one of the pages on this site (try the Edit button on this one!) and figure it out as you go along \u2014 it\u2019s really pretty straightforward. Modifications to content on this site You have two options for editing content: directly in your browser using GitHub, or using a Git-based workflow from your local work environment. Making contributions from your browser Every page on this site has an Edit button \ud83d\udd8d\ufe0f. If you click it, it\u2019ll take you straight to the corresponding source page in GitHub. Then, you can follow GitHub\u2019s documentation on how to propose changes to another user\u2019s repository. Making contributions using Git The Git repository for this site lives at https://github.com/citynetwork/docs . You can fork that repository, make the proposed changes in your fork, and then send us a standard GitHub pull request . If you would like to see your changes as you are working on them, you can do that with tox . Having checked out the topic branch with your modifications, run: tox -e serve A local copy of the documentation will then run on your local machine and be accessible from http://localhost:8000 in your browser. Quality checks There are a few checks that we apply to the configuration. They run automatically via GitHub Actions workflows when you send your PR: We check the commit message with gitlint , and enforce the Conventional Commits commit message style. We check whether the documentation still builds correctly, with your change applied. We check to make sure that no internal or external links in the documentation are dead. This is one example where the checks might fail through no fault of yours at all \u2014 some external link may have disappeared between the most recent change and your contribution, by pure coincidence. When that happens, we\u2019ll fix it together. We check some YAML conventions with yamllint . However, most contributions would probably only touch Markdown files and not YAML, so you\u2019re unlikely to trip over this. If you\u2019re working in your local Git repository and your work environment has tox installed, you can also run the checks locally: tox You can also configure your local checkout to run quality checks on each commit.

This will redirect you to the Cleura Cloud Control Panel, and since you are logging in from a new account for the first time, you now have to take three simple steps. Step 1 - Confirm your email . Check your inbox or your SPAM/junk folder for an email from no-reply@cleura.com with the subject Thank you for your registration - Cleura Cloud . Open that email and click on the link in the message body. Step 2 - Account information . After clicking on the confirmation link you move on to step two, where you enter all relevant information that uniquely identifies the brand-new account. Type in, for example, a username for the account user, and make sure you define a strong password for them. (A password manager may come in handy.) Please note that all fields are mandatory, so take a little time and fill them in accordingly. Should you have a rebate code, do not forget to click on I have a rebate code and type it in below. When you are done, click on the Save button. Step 3 - Account verification . While the new account is being created, and before it becomes fully operational, you have to take one last step toward verification. You do that either by entering valid credit card information or by placing a simple phone call. Should you choose to verify by credit card, rest assured that no charge will take place \u2014 no money will be drawn from the card, in other words.

As long as you do this with the same user account as the one that created the volume, this will succeed without further intervention. However, if you are trying to delete a volume that was created by a different user, you\u2019ll run into the limitation that the secret associated with the volume is owned by that user.
